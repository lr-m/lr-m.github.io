# Target

Did someone say some more Aliexpress rubbish? How am I supposed to move onto to useful targets when there is so many unique and entertaining targets for cheap? I seem to have a soft spot for attacking anything with a screen at this point...

![listing.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/listing.png)

I was immediately drawn to both the screen and the "Hot spot WiFi" feature.

# Teardown

This device was actually a bit of a pain to get into, but with enough force and some gentle persuasion with some pliers we got there in the end.

## Front of PCB

![pcb_front.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/pcb_front.jpg)

There isn't a huge amount of interesting stuff on this side of the PCB:
- Button array
- Speaker contacts (interestingly not soldered?)
- 240x240 Screen (ST7789 driver)

## Back of PCB

![pcb_back.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/pcb_back.jpg)

This side is much more interesting:
- Main MCU
- Memory Chip
- Camera connector
- Side control buttons
- Battery connector
- USB-C socket
- Microphone
- Micro SD card slot
- Is that a debug interface on the left of the SD-card slot??

### MCU

Lets have a closer look at that beefy MCU:

![mcu.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/mcu.jpg)

So its an SV822D EEASY-TECH chip, from their product listing:

> "The SV822D is a cost-effective AI SoC suitable for binocular IP camera, video doorbell camera, smart door lock, face attendance machine and other terminal devices. It integrates the self-developed NPU with up to 0.5 TOPS AI computing power, which can efficiently support intelligent algorithms such as human detection, face detection/recognition/capture, license plate detection and recognition, crying/abnormal noise detection, and so on. The SV822D ensures professional security ISP image quality, has a built-in 1 Gb DDR3L, supports fast boot and image output and achieves low-power applications. These features help the SV822D accelerate the development of smart security markets."

1GB DDR3 and a 0.5 TOPS NPU! Unfortunately there aren't any datasheets available anywhere, and it doesn't list the architecture, so we'll have to work that out later.

### Memory Chip

Lets have a look at the memory chip in case we need to do a chip-off later:

![memory_chip.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/memory_chip.jpg)

The part number is a pain to make out, it is a *ZBIT 25VQ128 NOR SPI Flash Chip* - this should be pretty trivial to dump if needed.

### Debug Interface

Finally lets look at the potential debug interface, turns out it is a UART (the TX label is a bit of a giveaway).

![debug_interface_labelled.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/debug_interface_labelled.png)

Hooking up a UART adapter and trying a few baud rates revealed that the baud rate is 115200, when when we connect we get the following:

![shell_output.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/shell_output.png)

Nice! Looks like we have a shell we can work with - after messing with commands, it was determined that the OS is RT-Thread 4.0.1.

![version.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/version.png)

# Firmware

## Extraction

After looking through the available commands, I found a **read_firmware** command, which I expected would just print bytes - but it actually just makes a **firmware.bin** file on the SD card which contains the contents of the flash chip - very nice.

## Analysis

Based on the shell, we know that the OS is an RTOS, so I expect to find a big binary rather than a nice filesystem full of ELF's.

Lets first check that it isn't encrypted with Binwalk and Cantordust:

![cantordust_entropy.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/cantordust_entropy.png)

![entropy.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/entropy.png)

By the looks of it, there isn't encryption, but there is a big chunk in the middle that is either HIGHLY compressed, or some rubbish 'encryption' has been used. There is a pretty good chance that it is some sort of compressed filesystem, and the 0.9ish entropy data before is code (the data at the start is also likely to be the bootloader).

Lets have a look at what binwalk spits out when we extract it:

![binwalk_output.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/binwalk_output.png)

So we get a couple of filesystems, and some data blobs - most of the files observed in the shell are located in the **cramfs** directory, so that is what the almost-encrypted data was.

Having a closer look at the **2494486-7000027** file contained in **2494486-7000027.lzo_extract**, this looks to be our big RTOS blob.

### RTOS Blob Analysis

At this point, I have a big blob, and no idea what the architecture is! You can identify most common architectures using the **-Y** option in Binwalk like so:

![architecture_guess.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/architecture_guess.png)

Nice, so we can now be pretty confident that it is ARM 32-bit little endian (*Note: you can configure the option to find longer chains of valid instructions if you want to be more confident in the output*).

So now I need to work out the base address as it isn't in a nice ELF format, so I employ the trusty **basefind2.py** script I've used on previous projects to have a stab at guessing the base address.

![base_address.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/base_address.png)

It seems to be most confident in **0xc0008000**, so lets go with that. 

Using the architecture and base addresses we have worked out, we get a valid decompilation in Ghidra!

### Manually Adding Symbols

Weirdly, when messing with the shell, I discovered that there is a **list_symbols** command, which lists an address and a function name for a bunch of functions (this would have been useful for working out the base address!).

As these symbols aren't present in the current decompilation we have, I wrote a quick Ghidra script to import them from the command output:

```
-python
from ghidra.program.model.symbol import SourceType

def apply_symbols_from_file(file_path):
    # Open the symbols.txt file
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Iterate through each line in the file
    for line in lines:
        # Split the line into symbol name and address
        parts = line.strip().split(" => ")
        if len(parts) != 2:
            print("Invalid format: {}".format(line))
            continue

        symbol_name = parts[0].strip()
        address_string = parts[1].strip()

        # Convert the address string to an Address object
        address = toAddr(address_string)
        if address is None:
            print("Invalid address: {}".format(address_string))
            continue

        # Get the function at the address
        function = getFunctionAt(address)
        if not function:
            # Create a new function at the address if it doesn't exist
            function = createFunction(address, symbol_name)
            if function:
                print("Created function {} at {}".format(symbol_name, address))
            else:
                print("Failed to create function at {}".format(address))
                continue
        else:
            # Rename the function to the symbol name if it already exists
            function.setName(symbol_name, SourceType.USER_DEFINED)
            print("Renamed function at {} to {}".format(address, symbol_name))

# Specify the path to the symbols.txt file
file_path = "/home/luke/Projects/Viidure/symbols.txt"

# Apply the symbols from the file
apply_symbols_from_file(file_path)
```

The command doesn't list every symbol, but its definitely enough to make reverse engineering this binary much easier.

# Finding HTTP Server Handlers

When I first got the camera, I went into the menu and turned on the hotspot, and downloaded and used the *Viidure* app which capturing with *PCAPdroid* to see what HTTP requests it makes to the camera. The endpoints I observed were:
- **/app/getparamvalue**
- **/app/enterrecorder**
- **/app/getadasitems**
- **/app/getsdinfo**
- **/app/getdeviceattr**

So this gives us a few strings to search for in the firmware to locate the HTTP request handler functions. 

With this knowledge, it didn't take long to find the responsible function:

![http_server_init.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_1/http_server_init.png)

Nice, so now we have a bunch of HTTP handlers to audit!

The first nice easy win is the **index.html** handler, which servers a testing interface that can send requests to all the handlers, set parameters, and download files. The only downside is that it is all in Chinese (and I can't speak Chinese so thats not good, nothing that Google Translate can't fix).

# Conclusion

In this blog, we got started with another Aliexpress device - this time an action camera. We tore it down, analysed the chips, extracted and analysed firmware, and found the available attack surface over the WiFi hotspot.
