In the first blog of this series, I left out the details of port 32108 as it mainly deals with the cloud interaction. I wanted to save that for another post. This post will focus on how the protocol operates when using the hotspot method with the camera (not connected to the Cloud, but still able to control the camera), giving us a solid starting point for reversing the cloud protocol later on.

# App Captures

We begin by examining the application and utilising Wireshark to capture packets exchanged between the device and the camera. These packet captures provide insights into how the app is designed to interact with the camera. We conduct these captures both during setup and the initialization of a stream.

The camera features a hotspot option within the application, allowing users to select it from the list of available connection methods. This functionality enables users to control the camera via its hosted hotspot, as well as access the stream. The process still utilizes the same ports, so there is a high chance of crossover when the connection is via the Internet. This option proves particularly advantageous for reverse engineering, as it avoids the need to interact with the manufacturer's server(s).

## Message Structure

Each message has the following header:

| Index | Length | Purpose              |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------- |
| 0     | 1      | *0xf1* - fixed value |
| 1     | 1      | Message type         |
| 2     | 2      | Message length       |

### Message Formats

I thought I'd include some of the message formats that were reversed for the initialisation procedure for some context in the next part.

## Re-implementing the Connection Procedure

By taking the captured packets and implementing a comparable sequence in Python, I was able to start a local connection to the camera (but it currently stops after a while due to me not acknowledging messages it was sending to me, poor camera).

After a bit of firmware reversing, I was able to strip the messages down to their minimum info while still opening a connection:
- Changed *LanSearch_EX* to a normal *LanSearch*, this removed the need for the "*tnp_uid*" in the message, reducing its size to 4
- If you don't send the *PunchPkt* immediately, the camera will send a *PunchPkt_EX* message anyway which includes the "*tnp_uid*", so we don't actually need to fetch it using "*ap_preview*" before initialising the connection
- I also used a *PunchPkt* instead of a *PunchPkt_EX*, meaning the timestamp and SHA1 hash at the end of the message is no longer necessary

These changes make the setup procedure much more straight forward! Here is how we do it:
1. Send 4 byte *LanSearch* packet
2. Wait for camera to response with its *PunchPkt_EX*, extract the "*tnp_uid*" from its response, and remember the port it used to talk to us
3. Send in a *PunchPkt* that contains the "*tnp_uid*" to the port it used
4. Camera responds with *P2PRdy* packet, now we have a connection

It looks like either the developers got lazy and copied to code for the cloud stuff (adding the extra unnecessary stuff), or there exists some other camera variant that uses the app with some additional security? Either way, any security the app tries to use can be removed and the connection still works.

Here is an example minimal initialisation: 

```
[*] Sending LAN_SEARCH packet to port 32108

# Firmware Analysis  

Now that we have an idea of what the messages we send to initialise the connection look like, we can try and hunt down the functions that are enabling this functionality in Ghidra.

## Where are connections initialised?

The first function that is responsible for listening for the *LanSearch* packets is the "**PPPP_Thread_Recv_Proto_LanSearch**", this waits for the *LanSearch* message, and when it sees one, chucks back a *PunchPkt* *packet*.

Another thread handles the *PunchPkt* that we send to the camera, its function is called "**PPPP_Thread_Recv_Proto_Device**", and handles messages after the connection has been initialised - including the *PunchPkt* we send to it.

## Other Message Types

There are a bunch of other message types that we can access in the "&**PPPP_Thread_Recv_Proto_Device**" function, not all of them are interesting but I'll put them here for completeness:

| Type ID | Name                  |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| 0x40    | MSG_PUNCH_TO          |
| 0x15    | MSG_DEV_LGN_SIGN_ACK  |
| 0x3a    | MSG_NOTICE_PING       |
| 0x3f    | MSG_NOTICE_TO_EX      |
| 0x32    | MSG_LAN_NOTIFY_ACK    |
| 0x6     | MSG_SESSION_RESPONSE  |
| 0x1     | MSG_HELLO_ACK         |
| 0x11    | MSG_DEV_LGN_PROXY_ACK |
| 0x8a    | MSG_RLY_TCP_TO        |
| 0xa1    | MSG_REPORT_REQ        |
| 0xb0    | Server config related |
| 0x90    | MSG_SDEV_RUN          |
| 0x82    | MSG_RLY_TO            |
| 0x84    | MSG_RLY_RDY           |
| 0x41    | MSG_PUNCH_PKT         |

## MSG NOTICE TO EX Message

This is one of the only interesting message types in this function (except *MSG_SDEV_RUN*, but that's not interesting because it appears to be disabled on this camera :( ). This message basically calls to a callback function with a JSON payload, this gives access to a bunch of commands:
- *TurnOn*
- *TurnOff*
- *OnLine*
- *UPDATE_HW*
- *LOG_STATUS*
- *REBOOT*
- *FORMAT*
- *RESET*

Unfortunately to access these commands, you need to have access to the device_key in the **/etc/jffs2/yi.conf** file, this contains other things like the "*p2p_id*" and the "*tnp_uid*". The only thing that appears to have access to this key is the server itself, so without having access to a shell on the device, it'll be challenging to get to these handlers.

Here is the format of the message:

| Index | Length | Purpose                                                                            |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 1      | *0xf1* - fixed value                                                               |
| 1     | 1      | *0x3f* - Message type                                                              |
| 2     | 2      | Message length                                                                     |
| 4     | 32     | Signature (the hash to be compared to the generated hash)                          |
| 36    | 32     | Time (a hexstring of the current time)                                             |
| 68    | 8      | Prefix (first 8 bytes of "*tnp_uid*" before first "-")                             |
| 76    | 4      | SerialNumber ("*tnp_uid*" part between the "-" converted to int)                   |
| 80    | 8      | CheckCode (last 8 bytes of "*tnp_uid*" after second "-")                           |
| 88    | 8      | unsigned long long containing the message index                                    |
| 96    | 2      | short containing the content length                                                |
| 98    | 1      | byte containing an interval value (the purpose of which is unknown)                |
| 99    | X      | Content of length X, the JSON payload that is parsed if the signature check passes |

### Reversing Message Signature Crypto

The method they use to generate the hash is a standard SHA-1 HMAC implementation:
- Part 1:
	- Initialise a buffer of 64 bytes with value of *0x36*
	- XOR the buffer with the key (until key length reached)
	- Feed this generated buffer to the sha1 instance
	- Then feed the input bytes to the sha1 instance
	- Output buffer of 20 bytes is filled with the output
- Part 2:
	- Initialise a buffer of 64 bytes with value of *0x5c*
	- XOR the buffer with the key (until key length reached)
	- Feed this generated buffer to a new sha1 instance
	- Feed the sha1 hash generated in part 1 to a the new SHA1 instance
	- Then the output of this goes into the output buffer

Here is a Python function that implements it:

```
-python
def gen_sha1_hmac(key, keylen, input, inputlen):
	info("Generating Yi SHA1 HMAC")
	BLOCK_SIZE = 64
	OUTPUT_SIZE = 20
	# Part 1
	ipad = bytearray(BLOCK_SIZE)
	for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE):
		ipad[i] = 0x36
	for j in range(min(keylen, BLOCK_SIZE)):
		ipad[j] = ipad[j] ^ key[j]
	
	info(f"First key XOR:\n{get_hexdump(ipad)}")
	
	# Hash the input using SHA-1
	sha1_part1 = hashlib.sha1()
	sha1_part1.update(ipad)
	sha1_part1.update(input)
	output_part1 = sha1_part1.digest()
	
	info(f"First hash:\n{get_hexdump(output_part1)}")
	
	# Part 2
	opad = bytearray(BLOCK_SIZE)
	for i in range(BLOCK_SIZE):
		opad[i] = 0x5c
	for j in range(min(keylen, BLOCK_SIZE)):
		opad[j] = opad[j] ^ key[j]
		
	info(f"Second key XOR:\n{get_hexdump(opad)}")
	
	# Hash the output from Part 1 using SHA-1
	sha1_part2 = hashlib.sha1()
	sha1_part2.update(opad)
	sha1_part2.update(output_part1)
	output = sha1_part2.digest()
	
	success(f"Calculated hash:\n{get_hexdump(output)}")
	return binascii.hexlify(output).upper()
```

Now we can sign any message we want going into the camera, but this of course requires knowledge of the *device_key* which is not easily obtained.

In the case of the *MSG_NOTICE_TO_EX*, the input that is hashed is everything after the signature (byte *36+*).

# DRW Messages

With our connection to the camera initialised and the connection procedure simplified, we can start figuring out how to interact with the camera. The first concept to introduce are DRW messages, these are messages of type *0xa0*, that have their own header, and also their own handler called "**yi_p2p_process_msg**".

## Message Format

The original header is still included before this one.

| Index | Length | Purpose              |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------- |
| 4     | 1      | *0xd1* - fixed value |
| 5     | 1      | Channel              |
| 6     | 2      | Packet Index         |
| 8     | 4      | *0x103000* - Version |
| 12    | 4      | Body length          |

Then the body is dependent on the type of message being sent, the message type is the first two bytes of the body. There are generally 2 body 'bases', one for messages that provide arguments, and one for messages that don't have arguments.

### With Arguments

| Index | Length | Purpose                                                        |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 2      | unsigned short - *message id*                                  |
| 2     | 2      | unsigned short - *ability set* (doesn't do anything)           |
| 4     | 2      | unsigned short - *offset* (offset into packet the data starts) |
| 6     | 2      | unsigned short - unknown (doesn't do anything)                 |
| 8     | 32     | string - *auth*                                                |
After this base is the message specific data.

### Without Arguments

This one is much simpler, it could be argued that the message id could be in the header (as it is the first element in both, but the firmware describes the header as the first *0x10* bytes so I've gone with that).

| Index | Length | Purpose                       |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 0     | 2      | unsigned short - *message id* |

## What can we do?

After reversing the various message types, there is loads of functionality, pretty much everything the app can do (which makes sense as the app uses this) and more:
- Device reset
- Format SD card
- Device restart
- Direction control (and jump to point)
- Change AP information
- Bind to WiFi network
- Light control
- Device info
- Device hardware information
- Plenty more!
There are a lot of handlers with interesting names, but they are not implemented, implying that this is some sort of SDK that has been built on for this camera.

## Example

To demonstrate where we are at currently, here is a simple demo of the packets sent that turns the light on:

In this blog, we figured out how to talk to the camera and send commands to it as if we were the application. We also reversed the signature generation, and explored the **libYIP2P.so** binary to enumerate our attack surface. In the next blog, we'll see if we can find some bugs!
