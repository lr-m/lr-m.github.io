# Target

As always, we'll start off with our target, this time its on the pricier side of Aliexpress, a whopping Â£80! Hopefully we'll get some security for that price right?

The NAS we are working with is a Hiksemi NAS S1H1, it seems to be quite new with only 10 sold on Aliexpress at the time of writing. I'd also never heard of 'Hiksemi', turns out its a branch of 'Hikvision' which are most known for their IP cameras - which makes sense as this NAS can apparently interface with 8 of these cameras.

A bunch of features are listed on the listing, namely the fact that its *"Not only a personal cloud NAS, but also a fashion item in your house"* - personally not to my taste... 

It also has a storage capacity of up to 12TB, has a 128M NAND flash and a Dual-cortex A7 ARM chip - that saves me some chip identification down the road. There is also, as always, an app that goes with the device. Overall, this seems like a pretty standard NAS.

# Brief Enumeration

We can do a bit of enumeration before we rip the thing to pieces.

## Port Scan

First we use nmap to find some open ports:

```
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-22 20:40 GMT Standard Time
Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.200
Host is up (0.0041s latency).
Not shown: 65529 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT      STATE SERVICE
80/tcp    open  http
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
548/tcp   open  afp
20443/tcp open  unknown
30001/tcp open  pago-services1
```

Nice, plenty of local attack surface here.

### HTTP Directory Searching

Visiting the IP of the device (192.168.0.200) yields no response which is interesting, usually these things host web panels for configuration. Either way, I pointed **dirsearch** at it to see if it could give any clues as to what this port is for:

```
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/api/2/dashboard
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/beta/repositories/go/group
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/tinymce/1/macro/preview
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/v3/doc
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/api/2/issue/createmeta
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/api/latest/groupuserpicker
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/v1
200    47B   http://192.168.0.200/rest/api/2/project
```

This implies there is some rest API listening on this port - this isn't useful at the moment, but it will give us some direction if we manage to get some firmware off of this thing.

# Teardown

The device comes apart quite easily, there are about 7 screws holding it together, and a couple holding the main PCB to the base.

## Top

The top of the PCB has all the connectors and the main SoC:

![top.jpg](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/top.jpg)

We can see the following:
- Connectors: USB, Ethernet, and power
- Reset button
- UART (with the connector still on?!?!)
- SATA connector
- Main SoC + Memory
- SATA Controller EEPROM Chip

## Bottom

The bottom of the PCB is much less interesting:

![bottom.jpg](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/bottom.jpg)

We can see the following:
- SATA Controller
- NAND Controller
- NAND chip
- Ethernet Controller Chip

## UART

The first thing to do is hook up to the UART, unfortunately I dont have a nice convenient plug for the connector, so I just soldered some wires on there and read it that way. 

![wires.jpg](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/wires.jpg)

The baud rate of the connection was 115200, unfortunately it doesn't throw us into a root shell, it prints out **Welcome to Hikvision**, then **hik login:**. Luckily this is pretty easy to get past with username 'root', there isn't a password which is handy!

This spits us into a 'Protect Shell', which only has two commands, **pt** runs a test binary which apparently isn't present on the device. The other command **date** listed the current date, funnily enough. Nothing much of use here!

![psh.png](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/psh.png)

This 'Protect Shell' appears to be a common feature in Hikvision products such as cameras, definitely worth investigating down the line.

# Dumping the NAND

As the UART wasn't very useful, we'll have to take the training wheels off and dump the NAND. 

I was planning on capturing the pairing process, and traffic coming from the app during use, but if I'm being honest the chip reader arrived before I had a chance (I had to donate my tester phone to a family member) - so lets just dump the chip!

## Removing the Chip

This is a TSOP-48 package, and the legs like to bend and break off so we'll need to be careful. I tried using a heat gun and focusing on the legs of the chip (in hindsight this was a mistake, R.I.P the capacitors that are somewhere in my carpet or the hoover), then discovered there was some sticky epoxy stuff under the chip that was keeping it on even with the solder melted. 

![tape.jpg](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/tape.jpg)

I ended up having to flood the legs with low-temp melt solder, and use a thin metal blade under the chip to work my way through the glue under the chip. Dabbing the iron on both flooded sets of legs repeatedly gave me enough time to gently pull away the chip from the board without destroying the pads - mission accomplished.

![desoldered.jpg](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/desoldered.jpg)

With the chip off, I cleaned up the pads on the board, and removed excess solder from the legs of the chip - luckily it still had all of its 48 legs, but it was a little bit warped from working through the glue - hopefully this won't impact the read!

## Reading the Contents

As I haven't dumped chips like this before at home, I don't have the equipment to read the chip. Of course the first thing I did was get on Aliexpress and buy a cheap-ish TL866 flash programmer with the attachment that fits this chip which arrived in about a week.

![read.jpg](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/read.jpg)

The software this flasher uses, *Xgpro*, and the website that hosts it couldn't look dodgier if it tried. I looked into using an alternative piece of software called *minipro*, but this wouldn't update the firmware of the flasher, so I ended up going with the dodgy software.

I cleaned up the chip legs, placed it into the NAND TSOP-48 adapter, connected this to the flasher, and opened the software. Then I just selected the chip model from the list of chips, and let it do its thing. I had to re-seat the chip a few times due to bad connections, but after this the chip read in about 20 seconds, and successfully verified.

# Extracting Flash Contents

So after dumping the chip, we have a big chunk of raw NAND, this will contain stuff like ECC and all that fun stuff so we'll need to strip that out. 

## Removing ECC

In this case, the ECC was obvious as there was a clear trend of *0x800* bytes of random-ish data, then *0x40* bytes of mostly *0xff*'s - pretty indicative of some ECC. Putting a Python script together and stripping all these ECC bits and bobs out leaves us with a slightly smaller jumble of data. You can see the pattern in the diagram above at the edges. Here is the same *binvis.io* representation of the ECC-less binary:

![no_ecc.png](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/no_ecc.png)

## Extracting Contents

There's a lot going on here, so the best way to describe the structure is to work through each stage. Its worth mentioning that I used *binwalk* and *unblob* heavily in this part, I've found that using one or the other is a bad approach, and using both and comparing the outputs is the best way - for some reason *binwalk* does better than *unblob* in some cases, and vice versa.

### Bootloader

At the start of the flash chip, there are four copies of the same bootloader - initially I was under the impression that the rest of the chip storage was encrypted as the entropy was pretty high, so I spent some time looking at the bootloader of the device.

I first carved out one of the four identical bootloaders. We know the architecture of the device is ARM v7 little endian, and I used my best friend *basefind2.py* to get the base address of the bootloader, *0x20000*. Once into *Ghidra*, the decompilation looked pretty good, so I got to investigating this encryption I thought was happening. 

Using strings from the binary, I was able to locate a bunch of similar code on Github, apparently for a custom WD passport firmware. With the source code available, I pivoted to looking into this. I checked for any encryption stuff going on, and there was supposedly some key stored in SRAM for decrypting the rest of the blob. However, the function that was called to decrypt the firmware never appeared in my extracted firmware - maybe there is no encryption?

### Config Partition

Before we talk about the main blob, its worth noting that I was able to locate an UBIFS in the dump using a tool called *ubidump* called *'config'*. I was able to extract the contents fine, and it basically contains a bunch of config text files - I guess this makes sense not to be encrypted if this is how you configure the device or something?

Here are the files inside:

![config.png](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/config.png)

There is definitely a bunch of juicy stuff here, including loads of keys for various bits and bobs. Lets move back to the main blob and see if we can extract any more information.

### Main rootfs

After looking at the config partition, I realised that this partition was pretty much one of the last parts of the flash. For some reason, I decided to strip off the config partition and re-run *ubidump* - this yielded another UBIFS filesystem called *'rootfs'* - finally! I have no idea why the tool didn't detect this, I assume its only looking for a single filesystem? Either way, we've got something useful here.

Extracting the contents of this filesystem yielded the following files:
- **drives** : This is an empty directory
- **basis.tar.gz** : More on this later
- **h99pro.dtb** : H99 Pro is a NAS offered by Hikvision, this contains loads of seemingly config values, or maybe a log of some sort
- **uImage** : Mentioned in **/tmp/factory/env.txt** as a **rescue_vmlinux=nand.uImage**
- **histor.tar.lzma.aes128** : This is definitely encrypted, does have a slight header that might yield some clues - more investigation needed
- **rootfs.img** : More on this later too!

### basis

This **basis.tar.gz** extracts into a pretty large set of files and directories, kind of resembling a part of a filesystem - not a full filesystem by any means. It does contain a bunch of binaries that seem very useful to us, namely **nas_client**, **stund_client**, **orbweb-connect-p2p-host**, etc. There are also a bunch of shared libraries and other stuff of that nature, it seems like this is responsible for a sizeable chunk of the NAS functionality.

![basis.png](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/basis.png)

### rootfs

The **rootfs.img** extracts into a file called **ramdisk**, running *binwalk* on the file indicates that it is an *ext2* filesystem (old Linux fun) - usually you can just mount these filesystems with **mount** like so:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/media
sudo mount -t ext2 ramdisk /mnt/media
```

However this yielded a bunch of empty directories, but also a bunch of error messages indicating that *'structure cleaning was needed'*,:

![failed_mnt.png](/assets/images/aliexpress_nas/failed_mnt.png)

This basically indicates corruption of the filesystem. At this point, I went away and learned about the ext2 filesystem, inodes, blocks, directories, groups - all that fun stuff. It didn't end up being of much use, but I found a bunch of great ext2 filesystem resources.

In the end, the problem was annoyingly simple. Initially, I noticed that when I was following the group table to find the groups, the address I ended up at usually wouldn't be the start of the group, it would be 14 bytes before the start of the group - weird. I'm not sure if this was a poor attempt of protecting the binary, or there was some issue during extraction, but between the first and second group, 14 random bytes had been added.

After wasting time learning all about ext2, and tracing through groups, directories and inodes - the problem ended up being these bytes. Removing these bytes yielded a successful mount, and we can finally see the Linux filesystem in all of its glory.

## Summary

To summarise, here is the structure of the flash chip, and the structure of its contents:

- 4 bootloader copies
	- **/tmp/factory/env.txt**
- 2 compressed partitions:
	- **rootfs** (UBIFS)
		- **basis.tar.gz**
			- **basis** (part of filesystem)
		- **h99pro.dtb**
		- **uImage**
		- **histor.tar.lzma.aes128** (encrypted)
		- **drives**
		- **rootfs.img**
			- **ramdisk** (ext2)
				- main filesystem
	- **config** (UBIFS)

# Conclusion

We started with a bit of enumeration, then took the NAS to pieces. We then managed to remove the chip (and not destroy it in the process) - obtaining a good read. We used firmware analysis tools to carve out files from the extracted chip contents (after dealing with ECC). And we've had a brief look at the contents - off to a great start!
