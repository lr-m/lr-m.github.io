## Hi, I'm Luke!

I work in cyber security and have a background in Computer Science. Although I primarily focus on vulnerability research, I also enjoy dabbling in programming, artificial intelligence, and visualisation.

I made this blog to gain some experience with React - this content was originally on a Jekyll-base blog generator, but I wanted some more control!

# ðŸ’» Technologies/Interests

I have experience with a bunch of technologies from university, and also from doing projects when I find something interesting:
- Vulnerability Research (currently focused on embedded systems)
- Programming (Python / C / C++ / Java / Javascript)
- Basic web development (React)
- Embedded Systems (ESP8266, ESP32, Digikey Stump, Arduino)
- Artifical Intelligence (simple neural networks, genetic algorithms, min-max trees)
- Visualisation (Processing, p5.js, three.js)

# Hobbies

Outside of work, I have a couple of hobbies:

### ðŸ’ª Gym
It's a fun way to keep active, and keeps me away from my computer for a while

### ðŸª´ Plants
I have about 30 of them - but I keep on buying more!
