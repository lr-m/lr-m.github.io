Ideally, we want to find bugs that require only physical access, i.e., I want to walk up to the camera, put in an SD card, and take complete control of the camera.

## SD Card Files

First of all, lets take a look at the files that appear on the SD card during normal operation:

- ***\mnt\***
    - ***record\***
        - Lots of directories that contain mp4 files
    - ***log\***
        - Log files
    - ***tmp\***
        - Current recording information
    - ***alarm_event.db***

## Record Files

Much like the other attack surfaces, it didn't take very long to stumble across some pretty trivial bugs!

### Stack Overflow

The ***/mnt/record*** directory contains multiple directories with name that look similar to the following:

```
2023Y01M06D16H
2024Y05M12D19H
2024Y05M12D20H
2024Y05M12D21H
```

Now the parsing of these filenames is fine as they use "%d" in their ***sscanf()*** call:

![record_dir_parse.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/record_dir_parse.png)

The issue is inside of these directories, each directory can contain multiple *.mp4* files which are titled with the following format:

```
10M00S60.mp4
11M00S60.mp4
12M00S60.mp4
15M25S24.mp4
```

If we look at the code that loads these filenames using ***sscanf()***:

![record_file_parse.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/record_file_parse.png)

We can see that it is using *%S* to extract number strings into a small buffer, then converting to an integer using ***atoi()***. Therefore, if we set one of these to be a huge number, we will overflow the buffer, e.g.:

```
09M00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000S15.mp4
```

### Triggering

Annoyingly, the bug will only trigger when these record files are loaded to send information to the app. This information isn't sent unprompted, so we need to send a DRW message of type *IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_GET_SD_INDEX*, which ends up calling *** yi_p2p_on_get_record_events_day*** to load the files - causing the crash:

![stack_overflow_crash.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/stack_overflow_crash.png)

This bug is pretty useless as we already have bugs in the hotspot functionality without needing to insert a new SD card. Therefore, I won't bother exploiting this one!

## event_list.db

This one is a tiny bit more involved, and just as useless, but still interesting!

### File Format

The file starts of with a header of the following format:

| Length | Purpose |
| - | - |
| 4 | Magic (0x88) |
| 4 | Entry count |

It then contains the entries, each entry has the following format:

| Length | Purpose |
| - | - |
| 4 | Type (always 0x1) |
| 4 | Start time |
| 4 | Duration (always 0x6) |

A very simple format!

### Global Overflow

When the camera turns on, it loads the ***alarm_event.db*** file from the SD card, and populates a structure with it named ***yi_ap_g_alarm_event***. This structure is essentially a singly-linked list, with each node (***enode_t***) containing a ***time_line_t*** object that holds the information, and a pointer to the next node.

There are no issues here as each node is allocated on the heap when it is loaded, there isn't a limit on the size, so you might be able to exhaust the heap with this. However, there is another way to break stuff.

If we send in a DRW message of type ***IOTYPE_USER_IPCAM_GET_ALARM_EVENT_LIST_REQ***, we can get to the ***alarm_event_refresh*** function, which calls the ***event_list_to_array_bytime*** function:

![list_array_by_time.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/list_array_by_time.png)

The third and fourth arguments of the function call are from the following struct:

![alarm_event_ctx_struct.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/alarm_event_ctx_struct.png)

As you can see in the function, it iterates over the entire list with no bounds checks, and the array that is passed in the 3rd argument can contain a maximum of 300 entries -> overflow.

![global_overflow_crash.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/global_overflow_crash.png)

Again, as this requires hotspot access, I won't write an exploit for this bug - it may also be a bit of a pain to exploit as its a global buffer.

## cloud_url_test.txt

So far, the bugs we have discovered don't satisfy the constraints we set out initially as they require hotspot access. 

However, after a bit more digging, I found that during boot it tries to load a file from the SD card called *cloud_url_test.txt*. If the file doesn't exist, it just cracks on, but if it does exist, the contents of the file are copied in the ***for_p2p_s.yi_cloud_info.api_server*** global. This basically tells the camera what the URL of its server is, and is the address it will use for the cloud connection.

![cloud_url_test_overflow.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/cloud_url_test_overflow.png)

I guess this was left over from testing during development and not removed? At least there will be a way of recovering the camera when the servers inevitably go down (if someone is willing to code a server replacement). What exactly does this give us?

### Stack Overflow

Taking a closer look at the function, we can see that if it finds the ***cloud_url_test.txt*** file, it uses a call to ***fgets()*** to load 256 bytes from the file into a buffer - no issue so far. The code then uses a call to ***strcpy()*** to copy the contents of the buffer into the ***apiUrl*** buffer which has been passed into the function.

Where does this buffer come from? If we step one function up, we can see that the buffer is only 128 bytes and is at the end of the stack frame - this means we have a very easy stack overflow. 

![small_api_buffer.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/small_api_buffer.png)

The only constraint is that this is a string based overflow, so no nulls. The good news is that before we return from the function that contains the buffer we overflowed, we copy the loaded ***api_server*** into a global region with a fixed address, the heap is also executable, so we can just jump straight to this and get execution!

The nice thing about this bug is that it works no matter what state the camera is in. I've written far too many exploits for this camera, so I'll leave this one as an exercise for the reader...

### Command Injection

The stack overflow is a cool find, however, a much easier method exists to get commands to run!

If we let the ***api_server**** get copied into the ***for_p2p_s.yi_cloud_info.api_server*** global, and take a look at where this gets used, we see the following during the cloud connection:

![cloud_url_test_injection.png](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_8/cloud_url_test_injection.png)

Looking at the arguments, *0x5227f8* is the address of the ***for_p2p_s.yi_cloud_info.api_server*** global! It is worth noting that the device will restart when the SD card is removed/inserted, so this code will run when the device restarts, and our command will run. The following payload works for playing a sound stored on the SD card:

```
helloworld.com ; /usr/bin/ak_adec_demo 48000 1 aac /mnt/audio.aac #
```

If we want to swap the SD card back out, but maintain reboot persistence, we can modify the ***time_zone.sh*** file in the ***/etc/jffs2*** filesystem to inject a command on every boot.

Annoyingly, if the device is in hotspot mode, this bug will not work as the cloud connection does not take place - however, we can just give it some credentials with a QR code or sonic pairing to achieve the same result.

## Conclusion

So, not even the SD card ends up being safe! Anybody can just walk up to your camera (no matter what state it is in) and easily take it over by just plugging in an SD card.
