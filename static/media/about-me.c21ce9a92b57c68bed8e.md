## Hi, I'm Luke!

I work in cyber security and have a background in Computer Science. Although I primarily focus on vulnerability research, I also enjoy dabbling in programming, binary exploitation, artificial intelligence, and visualisation. Most of my recent projects have been finding and exploiting bugs in cheap embedded devices, 

I made this blog to gain some experience with React - this content was originally on a Jekyll-base blog generator, but I wanted some more control!

# ðŸ’» Technologies/Interests
I have experience with a bunch of technologies from University, and also from doing projects when I find something interesting:
- Vulnerability Research (currently focused on embedded systems)
- Programming (*Python* / *C* / *C++* / *Java* / *Javascript*)
- Reverse engineering (Android apps using *Jadx*/*frida* and firmware blobs using *Ghidra*)
- Binary exploitation (on the hunt for self-discovered heap corruptions for experience!)
- Basic web development (*React*)
- Embedded Systems (*ESP8266*, *ESP32*, *Digikey Stump*, *Arduino*)
- Artifical Intelligence (simple neural networks, genetic algorithms, min-max trees, LLMs)
- Visualisation (*Processing*, *p5.js*, *three.js*)
