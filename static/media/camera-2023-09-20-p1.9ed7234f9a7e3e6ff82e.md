# Target

In this series of blogs, we will take a look at a cheap IoT camera, and its accompanying mobile app/cloud service. The camera in question is *5MP YI IOT 5G 2.4G WiFi PTZ Camera Indoor Use Auto Tracking Surveillance Camera Color Night Vision Baby Monitor Mini Camera*, which can be purchased in its absolute cheapest form (3MP and no SD card) for roughly £15.

## Features

The camera has a bunch of interesting features:
- Two storage methods: cloud and SD card
- Night vision
- App control (YI IoT)
- QR code pairing
- Two way audio (microphone and speaker)
- Alarm

## Teardown

With a little bit of force it is pretty straightforward to pry the back panel off, then you'll be greeted with this:

![back_panel_off.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/back_panel_off.jpg)

Yes, those are the wires that go into the antennas, and no, they are not connected to anything! There is also the little USB power board which is connected to the main board. Here is the wire removed from the antenna:

![wire.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/wire.jpg)

Why would you go through the effort of threading the wire into the antenna and out of the back if the antennas are just for show?

Anyway, if you rotate the camera, there are four screws on the bottom to remove, once these are removed, the top should open up - can you spot the UART?

![top.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/top.jpg)

Taking off the screws on the back, and removing all of the connectors for the motors, allows us to view the board on its own, which is all the teardown we need to do.

![bottom.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/bottom.jpg)

## Hardware

With the board exposed, we can take a closer look at the main components on the board.

### Lens

![lens.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/lens.jpg)

Not much to note here, I just thought it was cool that there is a little motor in there to swap the filters.

### Front

![front.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/front.jpg)

A little bit more exciting than the lens, here are the main things to note:
- Camera sensor, not sure why there is a little stick figure above it?
- The microphone can be seen in the lower left, as well as what looks to be a placeholder for a microphone connector on the bottom
- The *IRCUT* connector for the motor in the lens is located at the bottom
- A connector to the ring module on the left

### Ring

![ring.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/ring.jpg)

This module obviously contains the ring of LEDs as its right on the front of the camera, but it also includes another interesting looking module, I think this is the IR blaster for one of the night vision modes.

### Back

![back.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/back.jpg)

Finally, we can take a look at the rear of the main board:
- At the top of the board, we can see the SD card slot, and the reset button
- The hot glue covers the UART which I already soldered wires onto, refer to the teardown picture if you want to see the specific TX/RX pins
- There are connectors for the horizontal and vertical motors for control of the camera position
- *GallopMem 25Q64ASIG* EEPROM memory chip - Couldn't find datasheet, probably just a relatively standard EEPROM memory
- *ANYKA AK3918EN080* MCU - Could not find the datasheet but it seems to be relatively widely used in cheap IP cameras
- [SV6256P WiFi chip](https://95546ea185e54591.en.made-in-china.com/product/nQsRCzXKZMVL/China-FCC-CE-Lowcost-Factory-WiFi-Module-WiFi-4-BL-M6256AU2-Icomm-Semi-Chipset-SV6256P-IPEX-Antenna-WiFi-4-Module-OEM-ODM-Factory-Store-Wholesale-Engineer-Supported.html)

This camera seems to be made out of a lot of cheap and relatively undocumented components!

### Debug Shell

We've already run into UART in the previous router project, so it was incredibly straight-forward to set this up. The baud rate was the first one I attempted, *115200*.

Using *PuTTY* to connect to the shell yielded the following output:

![output.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/output.png)

Entering *whoami*, a Linux command to get the current user, returned this:

![whoami.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/whoami.png)

Shout out the manufacturers for the easy root shell! It is running a pretty standard Linux build, with a feature-full busybox included for all the commands you could ever want. Lots and lots of binaries in the */usr/bin* which we will try to extract in the next section.

# Getting Binaries

Before we can analyse binaries, we need to get access to them - at the moment all we can do is view them through the debug shell. Here are a couple of possible ways to do this.

## netcat

During the setup procedure, the device sets up a hotspot. Connecting to this hotpot on a Raspberry Pi was simple enough with the default password being '*12345678*'. Once we are connected, we can setup a *netcat* listener on a port, which will sit and wait for incoming information. We can then store the input in a file that will contain the binary.

We use the following command to do this:

```
nc -l -p 1234 > output.bin
```

On the camera debug shell, we have a Busybox version (basically a big combination of basic Linux commands) that contains *netcat* (a.k.a *nc*), so we can simply use this to send the contents of a file to the Raspberry Pi. We just need to find the IP address of the Pi by running *ifconfig* on it and getting the IP that starts with *192.168.10*, in this case, *192.168.10.20*. The following command will send the file to the Pi:

```
nc 192.168.10.20 1234 < /path/to/file
```

Now we have the file on the Pi!

## FTP Server

As this camera has an SD card slot, I was expecting there to be an FTP server running (confirmed later with port scans). Connecting to the cameras FTP server with *FileZilla*, and trying a bunch of default credentials like '*root*' and '*admin*' yielded complete access to the filesystem, binaries and all. The username/password was *root/no password* - very secure. 

I used *FileZilla* to basically extract the entire filesystem so that I have everything on my local machine, and this worked great! Much easier than running *netcat* on every file in the binary.

# Port Enumeration

As we already have access to a root shell through the UART, there isn't really much point in using *nmap* to enumerate the open ports - a *netstat* output is much more valuable.

```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

```

As you can see, there are a bunch of ports with unusual port numbers - these are always interesting to investigate. Also, its with noting that running *netstat* again after several reboots indicated the last two UDP ports do not have consistent port numbers.

With our nice *netstat* output, we can dive into the binaries we extracted earlier to find where these ports are being created, and what they are being used for!

## Local Ports

Lets first investigate the local ports and see if they do anything interesting.

### Port 8782

This port is created by the *cmd_serverd* process, it basically just sits waiting for connections, and chucks any received packets into either a call to **system()** or a call to **popen()**, depending on wether a result is expected.

Nothing interesting to note on this port aside from the fact if we see another process sending messages to this port, it is safe to assume that it is executing commands!

### Port 8899

Port 8899 is created by the *anyka_ipc* process. In terms of functionality, it appears to be a way of starting various threads/interacting with elements of the camera:

| Command Name | Purpose |
| - | - |
| *tips* | This plays a specified audio file on the device. |
| *ircut* | This enables/disabled night mode on the camera. |
| *photosensitive* | This looks like it turns on the LED ring around the camera. |
| *its* | This spins up a thread called *isp_tool_server*, which spins up more threads and a socket.  |
| *ats* | This spins up a thread called *audio_tool_server*, which spins up more threads and a socket. |

There definitely appears to be a bunch of interesting functionality in the *its* and *ats* commands, but it appears that the only binary that interacts with this particular functionality is the *ccli* binary, and anytime this binary is used, it is a hardcoded command that specifies an audio file to play. Therefore, it probably isn't worthwhile investigating the other commands at this point.

## Open Ports

As discovered earlier, there is an FTP server running on this port with username *root* and no password. The binary that handles this is called *tcpsvd*, and the FTP handler is located at address *0x1f3a8*. Not much to note here. There is also DHCP on port 67, the binary associated with this port is *udhcpd*, and the handler is located at address *0x3c4ac*. With the boring ports out of the way, lets look at the interesting ones!

### Port 6000

Despite the fact that *netstat* says the associated process is *anyka_ipc*, that doesn't necessarily mean it is present in the binary. This camera (and many many other devices) utilise shared libraries ending with *.so*, if a process imports a shared library that contains functionality to open a port, and this function is called, then the *anyka_ipc* process will be associated with the port. Therefore, we are going to have to look into the *.so* files for this one.

It didn't take long to discover that the *.so* file associated with the port is called *libcloudapi.so*, and it contains a bunch of interesting command handlers. Mainly to do with getting characteristics of the device, providing updates, and binding to a network.

There are a total of four commands that we can mess with, '*ap_log*' always seems to crash the device for some reason so I have omitted that for now.

#### *ap_preview*

This command is simply a getter for characteristics of the device, here is an example packet that is used to query this command:

```
-json
{"operator": "ap_preview", "time": 1694947334}
```

And here is the associated response:

```
-json
{"operator":"ap_preview", "tnp_uid":"T206900-632912-30316","did":"A2069004G3MJBW230316", "with_ptz":"1", "state":"OK", "is_white":"1","isHorn":"1", "trigger_light":"0", "light_time":"6"}
```

Not a huge amount of information, but interesting nonetheless, I wasn't aware the camera has a horn?


#### *ap_bind*

This appears to be able to bind to a network with supplied credentials. The credentials are provided in the packet in the json data parameter: the *bind key* (country code) is cleartext, the *SSID* is base64 encoded, and the *password* is XOR'd with a hardcoded key and base64 encoded. The credentials are in the following format **b=\*bind key\*&p=\*password\*&s=\*SSID\***. Here is an example packet generated by some Python code I wrote to create *ap_bind* packets:

```
-json
{"operator": "ap_bind", "data": "b=CN&s=aGVsbG93b3JsZA==&p=UFwmKjwdAEokMQ=="}
```

Once the credentials are extracted, they are saved to */tmp/wifi_info* and a bash script is called to connect to the network.

A funny quirk of this method is that if one of the bytes of the SSID/password is the same as the corresponding XOR key byte, a null (*0x0*) will be present in the string which will prematurely terminate the provided credential. 

#### *ap_update_name*

The most interesting command is the *ap_update_name* command, this appears to perform some sort of update procedure of the device. The JSON contains *name*, *length* and *md5* parameters. Here is an example packet:

```
-json
{"operator": "ap_update_name", "name": "test", "length": 15, "md5": "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"}
```

The socket accepts this, and sets a flag that essentially tells the socket to receive any incoming data and put it directly into the file with the provided filename until the amount of data received is equal to the provided length. It then uses the *md5sum* command to calculate the md5 of the saved file, if the md5 matches that provided in the initial message, the *update.sh* script is called to update the device firmware.

### Port 6789

Port 6789 is created by the *daemon* process, and it is another interesting one. It appears that once you connect to the socket, you must not close the socket you are using otherwise it will stop replying to messages.

The packet structure is quite interesting:

| Type | Purpose |
| - | - |
| short | Total Packet Length |
| byte | Unknown, if 4 restart service |
| byte | Unknown, if not 2 save filename |
| short | Length of string 1 |
| string | String 1 |
| short | Length of string 2 |
| string | String 2 |
| short | Checksum |

This process appears to be for running test binaries. When a packet is received, it is first parsed into a struct. The code first checks if the *last_filename* object in memory is not empty. If it isn't, it uses a script to kill the process with the provided name. Once this is done, if the 3rd byte is 4, the service is restarted? Otherwise, an **access()** call checks if the provided filename in string 1 is valid - if this is the case, it makes it executable with *chmod +x* and executes the binary. If the 2nd string is populated, it will give this to the test binary as a parameter. Once all of that has been completed, it checks if the 4th byte of the buffer is not 2, and if it isn't, it writes string 1 into the *last_file* string in memory.

How nice of them to leave some testing code on their production build for us to mess with!

### Port 8192

This is very similar to port 6000's *ap_preview* method in the sense that you request information, and port 8192 sends you some. It is handled by the *daemon* process and is started at address *0xb120*. It is a very simple socket that accepts a single string: **Anyka IPC ,Get IP Address!**. Upon seeing this message, it fetches loads of information, and chucks it into a 260 byte buffer, with the entries delimited with '@'. Here is an example response:

```
AKWIPC0000000010@192.168.10.1@255.255.255.0@192.168.10.1@194.168.4.100@194.168.8.100@1@小K互联网摄像机@2000@7c:94:9f:52:5a:e4@
```

There are a bunch of network config settings, some characteristics of the software such as version and system user, and also a mac address - an interesting collection of details.

### Port 32108

I will save the details of this port, but it is opened in *libYiP2P.so*, and it doesn't use the standard **listen()** call so it was a bit more of a pain to locate than the others. This port is essentially how the cloud configures and communicates with the camera, I want to fully reverse the cloud API stuff later on in this project, so I will stop here for now.

# Setup Procedure Bugs

Now that we know a little bit about what functionality is on the ports, its time to have a closer look and find some bugs.

## Port 6000 - Arbitrary File Write

Remember the *ap_update_name* command that creates files and allows you to write contents to the file? Well this allows you to write any file anywhere! There are absolutely zero checks on the *filename* that you provide, so just specify whatever location you want and you can write any contents to the file. Note that it tries to put the file into the */tmp* directory, but you can get back to root by putting '*../*' before the filename! Also, if the md5 check passes, then it will run the *update.sh* on the file - so do they delete the file if it fails like they probably should? Nope, they just leave the file on the device and carry on as if nothing happened.

![6000_afw.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/6000_afw.png)

## Port 6000 - Command Injection

Another issue with the *ap_update_name*, this time its a nice and simple command injection. To calculate the md5 of the provided file, they use the *md5sum* command. However, as there are no checks done on the filename, you can just slap a '*;*', '*&&*', or anything else on the end of the filename to achieve command injection. For example, doing the *ap_update_name* command with the filename **test; echo hello > /tmp/hello** will create a file called *hello* in the */tmp* directory - but only once the entire file has been received (well, the number of bytes you gave as the length in the first packet must be sent), at that point the md5 check occurs.

![6000_cmd_injection.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/6000_cmd_injection.png)

Here is an example payload:

```
-json
{"operator": "ap_update_name", "name": "test; cd tmp; echo hello > pwned", "length": 15, "md5": "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"}
```

Then you should get a confirmation from the camera:

```
-json
{"operator":"ap_update_name", "state":"OK"}
```

If you then send the contents of the file, in this case **hello camera :)**, you will have executed the commands.

## Port 6789 - Command Injection

Onto the next port, another nice and simple command injection, this time in the second payload string of the input. As we saw earlier when we reversed the service, they check if the string provided as payload 1 is a valid file, but there aren't any of these checks on the second string. As these strings are always put straight into a command with no further checks, we can get an injection on the second string.

![6789_cmd_injection.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/6789_cmd_injection.png)

Here is a hexdump of a sample payload:

```
28000300 01002e1f 002e203b 20656368 │(···│··.·│·. ;│ ech│
6f202770 776e6564 27203e20 2f746d70 │o 'p│wned│' > │/tmp│
2f70776e 65642023 b009              │/pwn│ed #│··│
```

## Port 6789 - Stack Overflow

The buffer that is used in the construction and execution of commands with **system()** calls is 260 bytes, the **recv()** call has a limit of 0x400 bytes, by providing a huge string as the second string, we can cause a stack overflow.

![6789_stack_overflow.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/6789_stack_overflow.png)

## Port 6789 - Global Overflow

There is a global overflow in the **strcpy()** call that copies the first payload string into the last_name parameter in the global region. Unfortunately, the only thing next to this string in the global region is some config values, and even if there was something interesting, we can only send things like '..' and '/' otherwise the **access()** call on the first string will not pass. The only thing you can do with it is crash the process by requesting config values on port 8192 after the config values are overwritten.

![6789_global_overflow.jpg](/assets/images/analysing_a_wireless_network_camera_part_1/6789_global_overflow.png)

## Port 8192 - Stack Overflow

In port 8192, it pulls values from the config files and copies them into a small buffer on the stack, if we use the file write we saw earlier to modify this config, we can simply make these files large and overflow the output buffer with our values. There are probably a huge amount of these kind of secondary bugs as a result of the file write we found, but I thought I'd include this one as it seems to be the easiest to exploit remotely.

# Conclusion

So we've torn the camera to pieces, had a look at the hardware, reversed the local/exposed ports on the access point component of the configuration process, and found a bunch of bugs. There are probably a load more bugs here, but it is highly unlikely these will be useful during normal operation - who knows, we might get lucky!
